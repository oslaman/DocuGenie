            "text": "Introduction \n\nM \n\nARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS was born on April 26, A.D. 121. His real \nname was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which \nclaimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most reli-\n\ngious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father, An-\nnius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, \nhad been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in lov-\ning remembrance. On his father’s death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the \nconsular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two. On the very first \npage of his book Marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to \nbe gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. The Emperor Hadrian \ndivined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, \nmore Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six \nyears of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian \npriesthood. The boy’s aunt, Annia Galeria Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, \nafterwards emperor. Hence it came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted \nMarcus, changing his name to that which he is known by, and betrothed him to his \ndaughter Faustina. His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers \nwere engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philoso-\nphy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to \navoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunt-\ning, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great \npersonal courage to encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from \nthe extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Fac-\ntions, as they were called, in the circus. The racing drivers used to adopt one of four \ncolours — red, blue, white, or green — and their partisans showed an eagerness in \nsupporting them which nothing could surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train \nof the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof. \n\nIn 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consum-\nmated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after \nthe tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him. \n\nAntoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state. He at once as-\nsociated with himself L. Ceionius Commodus, whom Antoninus had adopted as a \nyounger son at the same time with Marcus, giving him the name of Lucius Aurelius \nVerus. Henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire, the junior being trained as it \nwere to succeed. No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out \non all sides. In the east, Vologeses III. of Parthia began a long-meditated revolt by de-\nstroying a whole Roman Legion and invading Syria (162). Verus was sent off in hot \nhaste to quell this rising; and he fulfilled his trust by plunging into drunkenness and \ndebauchery, while the war was left to his officers. Soon after Marcus had to face a \nmore serious danger at home in the coalition of several powerful tribes on the north-\nern frontier. Chief among those were the Marcomanni or Marchmen, the Quadi (men-\ntioned in this book), the Sarmatians, the Catti, the Jazyges. In Rome itself there was \n"

            "text": "pestilence and starvation, the one brought from the east by Verus’s legions, the other \ncaused by floods which had destroyed vast quantities of grain. After all had been \ndone possible to allay famine and to supply pressing needs — Marcus being forced \neven to sell the imperial jewels to find money — both emperors set forth to a struggle \nwhich was to continue more or less during the rest of Marcus’s reign. During these \nwars, in 169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail; but \nthus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in crushing the barbar-\nian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure. Marcus \nwas himself commander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than \nto his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. \nThere were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has \nbecome celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle against the \nQuadi in 174, the day seemed to he going in favour of the foe, when on a sudden \narose a great storm of thunder and rain the lightning struck the barbarians with ter-\nror, and they turned to rout. In later days this storm was said to have been sent in \nanswer to the prayers of a legion which contained many Christians, and the name \nThundering Legion should he given to it on this account. The title of Thundering Le-\ngion is known at an earlier date, so this part of the story at least cannot be true; but \nthe aid of the storm is acknowledged by one of the scenes carved on Antonine’s Col-\numn at Rome, which commemorates these wars. \n\nThe settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for \nan unexpected rising in the east. Avidius Cassius, an able captain who had won re-\nnown in the Parthian wars, was at this time chief governor of the eastern provinces. \nBy whatever means induced, he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself \nemperor as soon as Marcus, who was then in feeble health, should die; and a report \nhaving been conveyed to him that Marcus was dead, Cassius did as he had planned. \nMarcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and returned home to \nmeet this new peril. The emperors great grief was that he must needs engage in the \nhorrors of civil strife. He praised the qualities of Cassius, and expressed a heartfelt \nwish that Cassius might not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the \nopportunity to grant a free pardon. But before he could come to the east news had \ncome to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away from him, and he \nwas assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and while there the murderers \nbrought the head of Cassius to him; but the emperor indignantly refused their gift, \nnor would he admit the men to his presence. \n\nOn this journey his wife, Faustina, died. At his return the emperor celebrated a tri-\numph (176). Immediately afterwards he repaired to Germany, and took up once more \nthe burden of war. His operations were followed by complete success; but the trou-\nbles of late years had been too much for his constitution, at no time robust, and on \nMarch 17, 180, he died in Pannonia. \n\nThe good emperor was not spared domestic troubles. Faustina had borne him several \nchildren, of whom he was passionately fond. Their innocent faces may still be seen in \nmany a sculpture gallery, recalling with odd effect the dreamy countenance of their \nfather. But they died one by one, and when Marcus came to his own end only one of \nhis sons still lived — the weak and worthless Commodus. On his father’s death \n"

Scandal has made free with the name of Faustina herself, who is ac-\ncused not only of unfaithfulness, but of intriguing with Cassius and egging him on to \nhis fatal rebellion, it must be admitted that these charges rest on no sure evidence; \nand the emperor, at all events, loved her dearly, nor ever felt the slightest qualm of \nsuspicion. \n\nAs a soldier we have seen that Marcus was both capable and successful; as an ad-\nministrator he was prudent and conscientious. Although steeped in the teachings of \nphilosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan. He \ntrod the path beaten by his predecessors, seeking only to do his duty as well as he \ncould, and to keep out corruption. He did some unwise things, it is true. To create a \ncompeer in empire, as he did with Verus, was a dangerous innovation which could \nonly succeed if one of the two effaced himself; and under Diocletian this very prece-\ndent caused the Roman Empire to split into halves. He erred in his civil administra-\ntion by too much centralising. But the strong point of his reign was the administra-\ntion of justice. Marcus sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the \nslaves less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless. Charitable foundations \nwere endowed for rearing and educating poor children. The provinces were protected \nagainst oppression, and public help was given to cities or districts which might be \nvisited by calamity. The great blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is \nhis treatment of the Christians. In his reign Justin at Rome became a martyr to his \nfaith, and Polycarp at Smyrna, and we know of many outbreaks of fanaticism in the \nprovinces which caused the death of the faithful. It is no excuse to plead that he \nknew nothing about the atrocities done in his name: it was his duty to know, and if \nhe did not he would have been the first to confess that he had failed in his duty. But \nfrom his own tone in speaking of the Christians it is clear he knew them only from \ncalumny; and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they should have a \nfair hearing. In this respect Trajan was better than he. \n\nTo a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small satisfaction. \nIts legends were often childish or impossible; its teaching had little to do with morali-\nty. The Roman religion was in fact of the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacri-\nfices and rites, and the gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In \nthis case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had been, \nthough to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early empire two rival \nschools which practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicurean-\nism. The ideal set before each was nominally much the same. The Stoics aspired to \nthe repression of all emotion, and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; \nyet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance, the other \nfor unbridled licence. With Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be \nworth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect. Zeno, the founder of \nStoicism, was born in Cyprus at some date unknown, but his life may be said rough-\nly to be between the years 350 and 250 B.C. Cyprus has been from time immemorial \na meeting-place of the East and West, and although we cannot grant any importance \nto a possible strain of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no philoso-\nphers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may have come in touch with \n"

After many years’ study he opened his own school in a colonnade \nin Athens called the Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name. Next \nto Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280–207 B.C.), who organ-\nised Stoicism into a system. Of him it was said, \n\n“But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch.” \n\nThe Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, as Zeno put \nit, to live consistently (ομολογουμένως ζήν) or as it was later explained, to live in con-\nformity with nature (ομολογουμένως τη φύσει ζήν). This conforming of the life to na-\nture was the Stoic idea of Virtue. This dictum might easily be taken to mean that vir-\ntue consists in yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic \nmeaning. In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary to know what nature \nis; and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is made — into Physics, dealing \nwith the universe and its laws, the problems of divine government and teleology; Log-\nic, which trains the mind to discern true from false; and Ethics, which applies the \nknowledge thus gained and tested to practical life. \n\nThe Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism. In con-\ntradiction to Plato’s view that the Ideas, or Prototypes, of phenomena alone really ex-\nist, the Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in the material \nuniverse was a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself under \nmany forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling principle. \n\nThe universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while leg-\nends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the god-\nhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes \nall things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of \nman is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in \nwhich the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone \nwhich enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul \nmust rule man. \n\nIn Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth, the \nCriterion. They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing. Up-\non this the senses write their impressions (φαντασίαι), and by experience of a num-\nber of these the soul unconsciously conceives general notions (κοιναί έννοιαι) or an-\nticipations (προλήψεις). When the impression was such as to be irresistible it was \ncalled καταληπτική φαντασία, one that holds fast, or as they explained it, one proceed-\ning from truth. Ideas and inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like \nwere tested by this “holding perception.” \n\nOf the Ethical application I have already spoken. The highest good was the virtuous \nlife. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its \nextreme, the Stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue and vice, \nthough of course each has its special manifestations. Moreover, nothing is good but \nvirtue, and nothing but vice is bad. Those outside things which are commonly called \ngood or bad, such as health and sickness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, \nare to him indifferent (αδιάφορα). All these things are merely the sphere in which vir-\n"

            "text": "tue may act. The ideal Wise Man is sufficient unto himself in all things (αυταρκής); \nand knowing these truths, he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack. It is \nprobable that no Stoic claimed for himself that he was this Wise Man, but that each \nstrove after it as an ideal much as the Christian strives after a likeness to Christ. The \nexaggeration in this statement was, however, so obvious, that the later Stoics were \ndriven to make a further subdivision of things indifferent into what is preferable \n(προηγμένα) and what is undesirable (αποπροηγμένα). They also held that for him \nwho had not attained to the perfect wisdom, certain actions were proper (καθήκοντα). \nThese were neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent things, held a mid-\ndle place. \n\nTwo points in the Stoic system deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction \nbetween things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, \nopinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, hon-\nour, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his \ndesires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the \nsway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by \ndivine Providence. This is a special application of the favourite Greek virtue of mod-\neration (σωφροσύνη), and has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point is \na strong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man’s duty as part of a great \nwhole. Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world, and it \nis here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive to note that Christian sages insist-\ned on the same thing. Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide \nbrotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that they live \ntheir lives as fellow-workers with God. \n\nSuch is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Some \nknowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book, but for us the \nchief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on \nStoicism. He is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students; he \ndoes not even contemplate that others should read what he writes. His philosophy is \nnot an eager intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling. The \nuncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and transformed by \npassing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle and free from guile; the grim \nresignation which made life possible to the Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood \nof aspiration. His book records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease \nit, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of \nduty and the countless annoyances of a busy life. \n\nIt is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, the Imitation \nof Christ. There is the same ideal of self-control in both. It should be a man’s task, \nsays the Imitation, “to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.” \n“In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.” “Let us set the axe to \nthe root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.” To this \nend there must be continual self-examination. “If thou may not continually gather \nthyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the \nevening. In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast \nbeen this day, in word, work, and thought.” But while the Roman’s temper is a mod-\n"

            "text": "est self-reliance, the Christian aims at a more passive mood, humbleness and meek-\nness, and reliance on the presence and personal friendship of God. The Roman scru-\ntinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt which makes the Chris-\ntian “vile in his own sight.” The Christian, like the Roman, bids “study to withdraw \nthine heart from the love of things visible”; but it is not the busy life of duty he has in \nmind so much as the contempt of all worldly things, and the “cutting away of all low-\ner delectations.” Both rate men’s praise or blame at their real worthlessness; “Let not \nthy peace,” says the Christian, “be in the mouths of men.” But it is to God’s censure \nthe Christian appeals, the Roman to his own soul. The petty annoyances of injustice \nor unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity. “Why doth a little \nthing said or done against thee make thee sorry? It is no new thing; it is not the first, \nnor shall it be the last, if thou live long. At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suf-\nfer joyously.” The Christian should sorrow more for other men’s malice than for our \nown wrongs; but the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender. “Study to \nbe patient in suffering and bearing other men’s defaults and all manner infirmities,” \nsays the Christian; but the Roman would never have thought to add, “If all men were \nperfect, what had we then to suffer of other men for God?” The virtue of suffering in \nitself is an idea which does not meet us in the Meditations. Both alike realise that \nman is one of a great community. “No man is sufficient to himself,” says the Chris-\ntian; “we must bear together, help together, comfort together.” But while he sees a \nchief importance in zeal, in exalted emotion that is, and avoidance of lukewarmness, \nthe Roman thought mainly of the duty to be done as well as might be, and less of the \nfeeling which should go with the doing of it. To the saint as to the emperor, the world \nis a poor thing at best. “Verily it is a misery to live upon the earth,” says the Chris-\ntian; few and evil are the days of man’s life, which passeth away suddenly as a shad-\now. \n\nBut there is one great difference between the two books we are considering. The Imi-\ntation is addressed to others, the Meditations by the writer to himself. We learn noth-\ning from the Imitation of the author’s own life, except in so far as he may be assumed \nto have practised his own preachings; the Meditations reflect mood by mood the mind \nof him who wrote them. In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm. These \nnotes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. There is always an air of self-\nconsciousness in confessions; in such revelations there is always a danger of unctu-\nousness or of vulgarity for the best of men. St. Augustine is not always clear of of-\nfence, and John Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins. \nBut Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but \nnothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he may not be pro-\nfound, he is always sincere. And it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed \nbefore us. Vulgar vices seem to have no temptation for him; this is not one tied and \nbound with chains which he strives to break. The faults he detects in himself are of-\nten such as most men would have no eyes to see. To serve the divine spirit which is \nimplanted within him, a man must “keep himself pure from all violent passion and \nevil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of discontent, either \nin regard of the gods or men”: or, as he says elsewhere, “unspotted by pleasure, un-\ndaunted by pain.” Unwavering courtesy and consideration are his aims. “Whatsoever \nany man either doth or saith, thou must be good”; “doth any man offend?

Perhaps he has fallen short of \nhis aim, and thus seeks to call his principles to mind, and to strengthen himself for \nthe future. That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius \nCassius, who would have usurped his imperial throne. Thus the emperor faithfully \ncarries out his own principle, that evil must be overcome with good. For each fault in \nothers, Nature (says he) has given us a counteracting virtue; “as, for example, \nagainst the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meekness, as an antidote.” \n\nOne so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend; and indeed his pages are \nfull of generous gratitude to those who had served him. In his First Book he sets \ndown to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers. To his grandfather he \nowed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his \nmother to be religious and bountiful and single-minded. Rusticus did not work in \nvain, if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending. Apollonius taught him \nsimplicity, reasonableness, gratitude, a love of true liberty. So the list runs on; every \none he had dealings with seems to have given him something good, a sure proof of \nthe goodness of his nature, which thought no evil. \n\nIf his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this is the more \nwonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians strong. He could say, it \nis true, “either there is a God, and then all is well; or if all things go by chance and \nfortune, yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern thee \nproperly; and then art thou well.” Or again, “We must needs grant that there is a na-\nture that doth govern the universe.” But his own part in the scheme of things is so \nsmall, that he does not hope for any personal happiness beyond what a serene soul \nmay win in this mortal life. “O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be \ngood, simple, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed”; but this \nis said of the calm contentment with human lot which he hopes to attain, not of a \ntime when the trammels of the body shall be cast off. For the rest, the world and its \nfame and wealth, “all is vanity.” The gods may perhaps have a particular care for \nhim, but their especial care is for the universe at large: thus much should suffice. \nHis gods are better than the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untrou-\nbled and uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger. On this point he says \nlittle, though there are many allusions to death as the natural end; doubtless he ex-\npected his soul one day to be absorbed into the universal soul, since nothing comes \nout of nothing, and nothing can be annihilated. His mood is one of strenuous weari-\nness; he does his duty as a good soldier, waiting for the sound of the trumpet which \nshall sound the retreat; he has not that cheerful confidence which led Socrates \nthrough a life no less noble, to a death which was to bring him into the company of \ngods he had worshipped and men whom he had revered. \n\nBut although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul was des-\ntined to be absorbed, and to lose consciousness of itself, there were times when he \nfelt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how unsatisfying is such a creed.

If worldly things “be but as a dream, the \nthought is not far off that there may be an awakening to what is real. When he \nspeaks of death as a necessary change, and points out that nothing useful and prof-\nitable can be brought about without change, did he perhaps think of the change in a \ncorn of wheat, which is not quickened except it die? Nature’s marvellous power of \nrecreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things. Many of his \nthoughts sound like far-off echoes of St. Paul; and it is strange indeed that this most \nChristian of emperors has nothing good to say of the Christians. To him they are only \nsectaries “violently and passionately set upon opposition.” \n\nProfound as philosophy these Meditations certainly are not; but Marcus Aurelius was \ntoo sincere not to see the essence of such things as came within his experience. An-\ncient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things. Do the neces-\nsary rites, and you propitiate the gods; and these rites were often trivial, sometimes \nviolated right feeling or even morality. Even when the gods stood on the side of right-\neousness, they were concerned with the act more than with the intent. But Marcus \nAurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do. “Such as thy thoughts \nand ordinary cogitations are,” he says, “such will thy mind be in time.” And every \npage of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act. He drills \nhis soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided \nby them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late. \n\nHe sees also the true essence of happiness. “If happiness did consist in pleasure, \nhow came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so \nlarge a measure to have their part of pleasures?” He who had all the world’s pleas-\nures at command can write thus “A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the \nsoul, good desires, good actions.” \n\nBy the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet joys and a \nmind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire when great dangers \nthreatened from east and west. For several years he himself commanded his armies \nin chief. In camp before the Quadi he dates the first book of his Meditations, and \nshows how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour of arms. The \npomps and glories which he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition \nor a dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of \nduty could carry him through. And he did his work well. His wars were slow and te-\ndious, but successful. With a statesman’s wisdom he foresaw the danger to Rome of \nthe barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures to meet it. As it was, his \nsettlement gave two centuries of respite to the Roman Empire; had he fulfilled the \nplan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the Elbe, which seems to have been in his \nmind, much more might have been accomplished. But death cut short his designs. \n\nTruly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can \ndo in despite of circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, a magnificent monarch \nwhose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent to obscurity yet born to great-\nness, the loving father of children who died young or turned out hateful, his life was \n"

Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily to believe \nthose things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work won-\nders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of \ncharms, and their driving out of demons, or evil spirits; and the like.

And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary \nsophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men \nunto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by \nway of ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man, for any kind of bodi-\nly exercises. And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of elegant neat \nlanguage. That I did not use to walk about the house in my long robe, nor to do any \nsuch things. Moreover I learned of him to write letters without any affectation, or cu-\nriosity; such as that was, which by him was written to my mother from Sinuessa: \nand to be easy and ready to be reconciled, and well pleased again with them that had \noffended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me again. To \nread with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor \nquickly to assent to things commonly spoken of: whom also I must thank that ever I \nlighted upon Epictetus his Hypomnemata, or moral commentaries and commone-\nfactions: which also he gave me of his own. \n\nV. From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not to regard an-\nything at all, though never so little, but right and reason: and always, whether in the \nsharpest pains, or after the loss of a child, or in long diseases, to be still the same \nman; who also was a present and visible example unto me, that it was possible for \nthe same man to be both vehement and remiss: a man not subject to be vexed, and \noffended with the incapacity of his scholars and auditors in his lectures and exposi-\ntions; and a true pattern of a man who of all his good gifts and faculties, least es-\nteemed in himself, that his excellent skill and ability to teach and persuade others \nthe common theorems and maxims of the Stoic philosophy.

Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with paternal affection; \nand a purpose to live according to nature: to be grave without affectation: to observe \ncarefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor \nunseasonably to set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the \ntheorems, and tenets of philosophers:\n\n4 his conversation being an example how a \n\nman might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his com-\npany were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer’s cogging and fawning; yet \nwas it at the same time most respected and reverenced: who also had a proper hap-\npiness and faculty, rationally and methodically to find out, and set in order all nec-\nessary determinations and instructions for a man’s life.

How free \nfrom all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are es-\nteemed): his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had \naught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially he would \ngive every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour or extremity, or when \nremissness or moderation was in season; how he did abstain from all unchaste love \nof youths; his moderate condescending to other men’s occasions as an ordinary man, \nneither absolutely requiring of his friends, that they should wait upon him at his or-\ndinary meals, nor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and \nthat whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put off and \nomitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he went about it again, the \nsame man that he was before.

It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both \n\nof the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that Lord and Governor of the world, \nfrom whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow: and that there is \nbut a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of \nto calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with it, \nand never after return. \n\nII. Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to perform what-\nsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned gravity, natural affection, \nfreedom and justice: and as for all other cares, and imaginations, how thou mayest \nease thy mind of them. Which thou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as \nthy last action, free from all vanity, all passionate and wilful aberration from reason, \nand from all hypocrisy, and self-love, and dislike of those things, which by the fates \nor appointment of God have happened unto thee. Thou seest that those things, \nwhich for a man to hold on in a prosperous course, and to live a divine life, are req-\nuisite and necessary, are not many, for the gods will require no more of any man, \nthat shall but keep and observe these things. \n\n10 do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to \n\nIII.

Every man’s happiness depends from himself, but \nbehold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost \nmake thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men. \n\nIV Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee? \nGive thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and \nfro. Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering, for they are idle in their \nactions, who toil and labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct \nall their motions, and desires. \n\nV. For not observing the state of another man’s soul, scarce was ever any man \nknown to be unhappy. tell whosoever they be that intend not, and guide not by rea-\nson and discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhap-\npy. \n\nVI. These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, \nand what is mine — in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of \npart, of what kind of universe it is: And that there is nobody that can hinder thee, \nbut that thou mayest always both do and speak those things which are agreeable to \nthat nature, whereof thou art a part. \n\n                                            \n10 [“Do, soul” (6). If the received reading be right, it must be sarcastic; but there are several variants which \nshow how unsatisfactory it is. C. translates “εύ γάρ ό βίος εκάστω ως παρ’ εαυτώ,” which I do not understand. \nThe sense required is: “Do not violence to thyself, for thou hast not long to use self-respect. Life is not (v. 1. ού) \n<long> for each, and this life for thee is all but done.”] \n"

            "text": "VII. Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such \nthings I grant may be compared): says well and like a philosopher, that those sins \nare greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed \nthrough anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction \nof himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome \nby pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposi-\ntion. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to \nbe condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this \nlatter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief \nthereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit \nanything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action. \n\nVIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so project \nall, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this \nlife. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society \nof men. The gods will do thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there \nbe no gods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to live in a \nworld void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods there be certainly, and they \ntake care for the world; and as for those things which be truly evil, as vice and. wick-\nedness, such things they have put in a man s own power, that he might avoid them if \nhe would: and had there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, \nthey would have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it. But why \nshould that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man’s life in this world, which cannot \nany ways make man himself the better, or the worse in his own person? Neither \nmust we think that the nature of the universe did either through ignorance pass \nthese things, or if not as ignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better \nto order and dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or \nskill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things both good and \nbad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both good and bad. As for life \ntherefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and pleasure, riches and pov-\nerty, all these things happen unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as \nthings which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither \nshameful nor praiseworthy. \n\nIX. Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and sub-\nstances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories \ninto the general age and time of the world. Consider the nature of all worldly sensible \nthings; of those especially, which either ensnare by pleasure, or for their irksomeness \nare dreadful, or for their outward lustre and show are in great esteem and request, \nhow vile and contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of all true life \nand being they are. \n\nX. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider \nwhat they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour \nand credit do proceed:\n\n11 as also what it is to die, and how if a man shall consider this \n\nby itself alone, to die, and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it \n                                            \n11 [“honour and credit do proceed” (12).

Consider\n\nand how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused. There is nothing \nmore wretched than that soul, which in a kind of circuit compasseth all things, \nsearching (as he saith) even the very depths of the earth; and by all signs and conjec-\ntures prying into the very thoughts of other men’s souls; and yet of this, is not sensi-\nble, that it is sufficient for a man to apply himself wholly, and to confine all his \nthoughts and cares to the tendance of that spirit which is within him, and truly and \nreally to serve him. His service doth consist in this, that a man keep himself pure \nfrom all violent passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all \nmanner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men. For indeed whatsoever \nproceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency; and whatso-\never proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us be entertained, with \nlove, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their ignorance, of that which is truly \ngood and bad, (a blindness no less, than that by which we are not able to discern be-\ntween white and black): with a kind of pity and compassion also. \n\nXII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands of years, yet \nremember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of \nlife, which he now lives: and that which he lives, is no other, than that which at every \ninstant he parts with. That then which is longest of duration, and that which is \nshortest, come both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past \nthere may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and in being, is \nequal unto all men. And that being it which we part with whensoever we die, it doth \nmanifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with. For \nas for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part \nwith it. For how should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things \ntherefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from all eternity, by \na perpetual revolution of the same times and things ever continued and renewed, are \nof one kind and nature; so that whether for a hundred or two hundred years only, or \nfor an infinite space of time, a man see those things which are still the same, it can \nbe no matter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the longest liv-\ner, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that \nonly which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only \nwhich they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose. \n\nXIII. Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things are plain and ap-\nparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as plain and apparent is \nthe use that may be made of those things, if that which is true and serious in them, \nbe received as well as that which is sweet and pleasing. \n\nXIV. A man’s soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially, when as \nmuch as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an excrescency of the \nworld, for to be grieved and displeased with anything that happens in the world, is \n\n                                            \n12 [“Consider,” etc. (12).

The time of a man’s life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense \nobscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is \nrestless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all \nthings belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto \nthe soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better \nthan oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philoso-\nphy.

Thou \nmust hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day nearer unto death than \nother, but also because that intellective faculty in thee, whereby thou art enabled to \nknow the true nature of things, and to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth \ndaily waste and decay: or, may fail thee before thou die. \n\nII. This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally doth happen to \nthings natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing and delightful: as a great loaf \nwhen it is baked, some parts of it cleave as it were, and part asunder, and make the \ncrust of it rugged and unequal, and yet those parts of it, though in some sort it be \nagainst the art and intention of baking itself, that they are thus cleft and parted, \nwhich should have been and were first made all even and uniform, they become it \nwell nevertheless, and have a certain peculiar property, to stir the appetite.

The hanging down of grapes, the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild \nboar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they are far from \nany beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both are comely, and delightful; \nso that if a man shall with a profound mind and apprehension, consider all things in \nthe world, even among all those things which are but mere accessories and natural \nappendices as it were, there will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will \nnot find matter of pleasure and delight.

Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor \nthe acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those excerpta from several books; \nall which thou hadst provided and laid up for thyself against thine old age. Hasten \ntherefore to an end, and giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest \nfor thyself, as thou oughtest to do. \n\nXVI. To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done (which is not \nseen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight): what these words mean, and how \nmany ways to be understood, they do not understand. The body, the soul, the un-\nderstanding. As the senses naturally belong to the body, and the desires and affec-\ntions to the soul, so do the dogmata to the understanding. \n\nXVII. To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and beast. To be \nviolently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires of the soul, is proper to wild \nbeasts and monsters, such as Phalaris and Nero were. To follow reason for ordinary \nduties and actions is common to them also, who believe not that there be any gods, \nand for their advantage would make no conscience to betray their own country; and \nwho when once the doors be shut upon them, dare do anything. If therefore all \nthings else be common to these likewise, it follows, that for a man to like and em-\nbrace all things that happen and are destinated unto him, and not to trouble and \nmolest that spirit which is seated in the temple of his own breast, with a multitude of \nvain fancies and imaginations, but to keep him propitious and to obey him as a god, \n"

For it never doth \nabsolutely addict and apply itself to any one object, but whatsoever it is that it doth \nnow intend and prosecute, it doth prosecute it with exception and reservation; so \nthat whatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even that after-\nwards it makes its proper object. Even as the fire when it prevails upon those things \nthat are in his way; by which things indeed a little fire would have been quenched, \nbut a great fire doth soon turn to its own nature, and so consume whatsoever comes \nin his way: yea by those very things it is made greater and greater. \n\nII.

They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-\nshore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all \nthis thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time \nsoever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free \nfrom all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he \nespecially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he \ndoth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and \ntranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, \nfree from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring contin-\nually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and funda-\nmental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy \nsoul throughly, and to send thee away well pleased with those things whatsoever \nthey be, which now again after this short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou \ndost return unto. For what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wicked-\nness of men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable crea-\ntures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to bear with them? and \nthat it is against their wills that they offend? and how many already, who once like-\nwise prosecuted their enmities, suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now \nlong ago stretched out, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. \nAs for those things which among the common chances of the world happen unto thee \nas thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with any of them, when \nthou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind, either a providence, or Democritus \nhis atoms; and with it, whatsoever we brought to prove that the whole world is as it \nwere one city? And as for thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that \nthy mind and understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own \npower, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently, or whether \nharshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether indifferent: and whatsoever \nelse thou hast heard and assented unto concerning either pain or pleasure?

For the whole earth is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is \nbut a very little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of \nmen are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou often put \nin practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself; and above all \nthings, keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be \nfree and consider all things, as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose \ntrue nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among oth-\ner things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw thyself, let \nthose two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects \nthemselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is \nfrom the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth \nproceed. The next, that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very \nlittle while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many changes \nand alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy \ntime. This world is mere change, and this life, opinion. \n\nIV. If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then is that rea-\nson, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If reason is general, then \nis that reason also, which prescribeth what is to be done and what not, common un-\nto all. If that, then law. If law, then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners \nin some one commonweal. If so, then the world is as it were a city. For which other \ncommonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of? From this common \ncity it is, that understanding, reason, and law is derived unto us, for from whence \nelse? For as that which in me is earthly I have from some common earth; and that \nwhich is moist from some other element is imparted; as my breath and life hath its \nproper fountain; and that likewise which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is nothing \nwhich doth not proceed from something; as also there is nothing that can be reduced \nunto mere nothing): so also is there some common beginning from whence my un-\nderstanding bath proceeded. \n\nV. As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature’s wisdom: a mixture of elements, \nresolved into the same elements again, a thing surely which no man ought to be \nashamed of: in a series of other fatal events and consequences, which a rational \ncreature is subject unto, not improper or incongruous, nor contrary to the natural \nand proper constitution of man himself. \n\nVI. Such and such things, from such and such causes, must of necessity proceed. \nHe that would not have such things to happen, is as he that would have the fig-tree \ngrow without any sap or moisture. In sum, remember this, that within a very little \nwhile, both thou and he shall both be dead, and after a little while more, not so \nmuch as your names and memories shall be remaining. \n\nVII.

First, do nothing at all, \nbut what reason proceeding from that regal and supreme part, shall for the good and \nbenefit of men, suggest unto thee. And secondly, if any man that is present shall be \nable to rectify thee or to turn thee from some erroneous persuasion, that thou be al-\nways ready to change thy mind, and this change to proceed, not from any respect of \nany pleasure or credit thereon depending, but always from some probable apparent \nground of justice, or of some public good thereby to be furthered; or from some other \nsuch inducement. \n\nXI.

For as for that, that it is \n\nthe gift of nature, whatsoever is commended in thee, what might be objected from \nthence, let that now that we are upon another consideration be omitted as unsea-\nsonable. That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and in what respect soever \nit be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of itself, and terminates in itself, not admitting \npraise as a part or member: that therefore which is praised, is not thereby made ei-\nther better or worse. This I understand even of those things, that are commonly \ncalled fair and good, as those which are commended either for the matter itself, or for \ncurious workmanship. As for that which is truly good, what can it stand in need of \nmore than either justice or truth; or more than either kindness and modesty? Which \nof all those, either becomes good or fair, because commended; or dispraised suffers \nany damage? Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it be not com-\nmended?

If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not believe it); how \nis the air from all eternity able to contain them? How is the earth (say I) ever from \nthat time able to Contain the bodies of them that are buried? For as here the change \nand resolution of dead bodies into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be); \nmakes place for other dead bodies: so the souls after death transferred into the air, \nafter they have conversed there a while, are either by way of transmutation, or trans-\nfusion, or conflagration, received again into that original rational substance, from \nwhich all others do proceed: and so give way to those souls, who before coupled and \nassociated unto bodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a supposition that \nthe souls after death do for a while subsist single, may be answered. And here, (be-\nsides the number of bodies, so buried and contained by the earth), we may further \nconsider the number of several beasts, eaten by us men, and by other creatures. For \nnotwithstanding that such a multitude of them is daily consumed, and as it were \nburied in the bodies of the eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain \nthem, by reason of their conversion, partly into blood, partly into air and fire.

This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which \nfrom the goodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually pro-\nceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either speak or do, are \nunnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs follow that he shall thereby \ngain much leisure, and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man must \nprivately by way of admonition suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I \ngo about, be of the number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to \ncut off actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also, that are unnecessary for so \nwill unnecessary consequent actions the better be prevented and cut off. \n\nXXI.

It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it \ntrouble thee? Hath anything happened unto thee? It is well, whatsoever it be, it is \nthat which of all the common chances of the world from the very beginning in the se-\nries of all other things that have, or shall happen, was destinated and appointed un-\nto thee.

How many astrologers, after that in great ostentation they had foretold \nthe death of some others, how many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and \nvolumes concerning either mortality or immortality; how many brave captains and \ncommanders, after the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and ty-\nrants, after they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon men’s \nlives, as though themselves had been immortal; how many, that I may so speak, \nwhole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innu-\nmerable are dead and gone. Run them over also, whom thou thyself, one after anoth-\ner, hast known in thy time to drop away. Such and such a one took care of such and \nsuch a one’s burial, and soon after was buried himself. So one, so another: and all \nthings in a short time. For herein lieth all\n\n15 indeed, ever to look upon all worldly \n\nthings, as things for their continuance, that are but for a day: and for their worth, \nmost vile, and contemptible, as for example, What is man? That which but the other \nday when he was conceived was vile snivel; and within few days shall be either an \nembalmed carcass, or mere ashes. Thus must thou according to truth and nature, \nthroughly consider how man’s life is but for a very moment of time, and so depart \nmeek and contented: even as if a ripe olive falling should praise the ground that bare \nher, and give thanks to the tree that begat her. \n\nXL. Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though the waves beat \ncontinually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are those swelling waves stilled and \nquieted. \n\n                                            \n15 [“For herein lieth all” (16).

Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I, to whom \nthis thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither wounded by that \nwhich is present, nor in fear of that which is to come. For as for this, it might have \nhappened unto any man, but any man having such a thing befallen him, could not \nhave continued without grief. Why then should that rather be an unhappiness, than \nthis a happiness? But however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is \nno mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the na-\nture of man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What then hast \nthou learned is the will of man’s nature? Doth that then which hath happened unto \nthee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or temperate? or wise? or cir-\ncumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from anything else of all those things in \nthe present enjoying and possession whereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all \nthat is proper unto her), is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sor-\nrow remember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is that hath \nhappened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself, as a misfortune; but that \nto bear it generously, is certainly great happiness. \n\nXLII. It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual remedy against the \nfear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily \nand covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their lives. What have they got \nmore, than they whose deaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at \nthe last? as Cadiciant’s, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their lifetime \nhaving buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The whole space of any \nman’s life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of \ndispositions, and in the society of how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be \ntherefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look \nbackward; behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and \nas infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is so infinite, what dif-\nference can there be between that which liveth but three days, and that which liveth \nthree ages? \n\nXLIII. Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most compendious, is \nthat which is according to nature: that is, in all both words and deeds, ever to follow \nthat which is most sound and perfect. For such a resolution will free a man from all \ntrouble, strife, dissembling, and ostentation. \n"

Am I then yet un-\nwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought forth into this \n\nworld? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm \nbed? “O but this is pleasing.” And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou \nmightest enjoy pleasure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mightest always \nbe busy and in action? Seest thou not how all things in the world besides, how every \ntree and plant, how sparrows and ants, spiders and bees: how all in their kind are \nintent as it were orderly to perform whatsoever (towards the preservation of this or-\nderly universe) naturally doth become and belong unto thin? And wilt not thou do \nthat, which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy na-\nture doth require? “But thou must have some rest.” Yes, thou must. Nature hath of \nthat also, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed thee a certain stint. But thou \nguest beyond thy stint, and beyond that which would suffice, and in matter of action, \nthere thou comest short of that which thou mayest. It must needs be therefore, that \nthou dost not love thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst also love thy nature, and \nthat which thy nature doth propose unto herself as her end. Others, as many as take \npleasure in their trade and profession, can even pine themselves at their works, and \nneglect their bodies and their food for it; and doest thou less honour thy nature, than \nan ordinary mechanic his trade; or a good dancer his art? than a covetous man his \nsilver, and vainglorious man applause? These to whatsoever they take an affection, \ncan be content to want their meat and sleep, to further that every one which he af-\nfects: and shall actions tending to the common good of human society, seem more \nvile unto thee, or worthy of less respect and intention? \n\nII.

If it be right and honest to be spoken or done, undervalue not thyself so much, \nas to be discouraged from it. As for them, they have their own rational over-ruling \npart, and their own proper inclination: which thou must not stand and look about to \ntake notice of, but go on straight, whither both thine own particular, and the com-\nmon nature do lead thee; and the way of both these, is but one. \n\nIV. I continue my course by actions according to nature, until I fall and cease, \nbreathing out my last breath into that air, by which continually breathed in I did live; \nand falling upon that earth, out of whose gifts and fruits my father gathered his seed, \nmy mother her blood, and my nurse her milk, out of which for so many years I have \nbeen provided, both of meat and drink. And lastly, which beareth me that tread upon \nit, and beareth with me that so many ways do abuse it, or so freely make use of it, so \nmany ways to so many ends. \n\nV.

Others there be, who though they \nstand not upon retaliation, to require any, yet they think with themselves neverthe-\nless, that such a one is their debtor, and they know as their word is what they have \ndone. Others again there be, who when they have done any such thing, do not so \nmuch as know what they have done; but are like unto the vine, which beareth her \ngrapes, and when once she hath borne her own proper fruit, is contented and seeks \nfor no further recompense. As a horse after a race, and a hunting dog when he hath \nhunted, and a bee when she hath made her honey, look not for applause and com-\nmendation; so neither doth that man that rightly doth understand his own nature \nwhen he hath done a good turn: but from one doth proceed to do another, even as \nthe vine after she hath once borne fruit in her own proper season, is ready for anoth-\ner time. Thou therefore must be one of them, who what they do, barely do it without \nany further thought, and are in a manner insensible of what they do. “Nay but,” will \nsome reply perchance, “this very thing a rational man is bound unto, to understand \nwhat it is, that he doeth.” For it is the property, say they, of one that is naturally so-\nciable, to be sensible, that he doth operate sociably: nay, and to desire, that the par-\nty him self that is sociably dealt with, should be sensible of it too. I answer, That \nwhich thou sayest is true indeed, but the true meaning of that which is said, thou \ndost not understand. And therefore art thou one of those first, whom I mentioned. \nFor they also are led by a probable appearance of reason. But if thou dost desire to \nunderstand truly what it is that is said, fear not that thou shalt therefore give over \nany sociable action. \n\nVII.

Is it \nnot for that respect especially, that pleasure itself is to so many men’s hurt and over-\nthrow, most prevalent, because esteemed commonly most kind, and natural? But \nconsider well whether magnanimity rather, and true liberty, and true simplicity, and \nequanimity, and holiness; whether these be not most kind and natural?

But as for those which by the vulgar are \nesteemed good, if he shall hear them mentioned as good, he doth hearken for more. \nHe is well contented to hear, that what is spoken by the comedian, is but familiarly \nand popularly spoken, so that even the vulgar apprehend the difference.

No corruption can reduce either of \nthese unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing become a subsistent creature. Every \npart of mine then. will by mutation be disposed into a certain part of the whole \nworld, and that in time into another part; and so in infinitum; by which kind of muta-\ntion, I also became what I am, and so did they that begot me, and they before them, \nand so upwards in infinitum. For so we may be allowed to speak, though the age and \ngovernment of the world, be to some certain periods of time limited, and confined. \n\nXIV. Reason, and rational power, are faculties which content themselves with them-\nselves, and their own proper operations. And as for their first inclination and motion, \nthat they take from themselves. But their progress is right to the end and object, \nwhich is in their way, as it were, and lieth just before them: that is, which is feasible \nand possible, whether it be that which at the first they proposed to themselves, or \nno. For which reason also such actions are termed κατορθώσεις,\n\n16 to intimate the di-\n\nrectness of the way, by which they are achieved. Nothing must be thought to belong \nto a man, which doth not belong unto him as he is a man. These, the event of pur-\nposes, are not things required in a man. The nature of man doth not profess any \nsuch things. The final ends and consummations of actions are nothing at all to a \nman’s nature. The end therefore of a man, or the summum bonum whereby that end \nis fulfilled, cannot consist in the consummation of actions purposed and intended. \nAgain, concerning these outward worldly things, were it so that any of them did \nproperly belong unto man, then would it not belong unto man, to condemn them and \nto stand in opposition with them. Neither would he be praiseworthy that can live \nwithout them; or he good, (if these were good indeed) who of his own accord doth de-\nprive himself of any of them. But we see contrariwise, that the more a man doth \nwithdraw himself from these wherein external pomp and greatness doth consist, or \nany other like these; or the better he doth bear with the loss of these, the better he is \naccounted. \n\nXV. Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy mind be in \ntime. For the soul doth as it were receive its tincture from the fancies, and imagina-\ntions. Dye it therefore and thoroughly soak it with the assiduity of these cogitations. \nAs for example. Wheresoever thou mayest live, there it is in thy power to live well and \nhappy. But thou mayest live at the Court, there then also mayest thou live well and \nhappy. Again, that which everything is made for, he is also made unto that, and \ncannot but naturally incline unto it.

And those things that have souls, are better than \nthose that have none? and of those that have, those best that have rational souls? \n\nXVI. To desire things impossible is the part of a mad man. But it is a thing impossi-\nble, that wicked man should not commit some such things.

For by these the mind doth turn and convert any impediment whatsoever, to \nbe her aim and purpose.

What can he do? such is his breath naturally, and such are his \narm holes; and from such, such an effect, and such a smell must of necessity pro-\nceed. “O, but the man (sayest thou) hath understanding in him, and might of himself \nknow, that he by standing near, cannot choose but offend.” And thou also (God bless \nthee!) hast understanding. Let thy reasonable faculty, work upon his reasonable fac-\nulty; show him his fault, admonish him. If he hearken unto thee, thou hast cured \nhim, and there will be no more occasion of anger. \n\nXXIII. “Where there shall neither roarer be, nor harlot.” Why so? As thou dost pur-\npose to live, when thou hast retired thyself to some such place, where neither roar-\ner\n\n17 nor harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if they will not suffer thee, then mayest \n\nthou leave thy life rather than thy calling, but so as one that doth not think himself \nanyways wronged. Only as one would say, Here is a smoke; I will out of it. And what \na great matter is this! Now till some such thing force me out, I will continue free; nei-\n\n                                            \n17 [“Roarer” (28): Gr. “tragedian.” Ed. 1 has “whoremonger,” ed. 2 corrects to “harlot,” but omits to alter the \nword at its second occurrence.] \n"

And again \nmore generally; This phalernum, this excellent highly commended wine, is but the \nbare juice of an ordinary grape. This purple robe, but sheep’s hairs, dyed with the \nblood of a shellfish.

Not vegetative spiration, it is not surely (which plants have) that in this life \nshould be so dear unto us; nor sensitive respiration, the proper life of beasts, both \ntame and wild; nor this our imaginative faculty; nor that we are subject to be led and \ncarried up and down by the strength of our sensual appetites; or that we can gather, \nand live together; or that we can feed: for that in effect is no better, than that we can \nvoid the excrements of our food. What is it then that should be dear unto us? to hear \na clattering noise? if not that, then neither to be applauded by the tongues of men. \nFor the praises of many tongues, is in effect no better than the clattering of so many \ntongues.

This I think: that in all thy motions and actions thou be moved, and restrained \naccording to thine own true natural constitution and Construction only. And to this \neven ordinary arts and professions do lead us. For it is that which every art doth aim \nat, that whatsoever it is, that is by art effected and prepared, may be fit for that work \nthat it is prepared for.

Again, how he was no backbiter, nor easily frightened, nor suspi-\ncious, and in his language free from all affectation and curiosity: and how easily he \nwould content himself with few things, as lodging, bedding, clothing, and ordinary \nnourishment, and attendance. How able to endure labour, how patient; able through \nhis spare diet to continue from morning to evening without any necessity of with-\ndrawing before his accustomed hours to the necessities of nature: his uniformity and \nconstancy in matter of friendship. How he would bear with them that with all bold-\nness and liberty opposed his opinions; and even rejoice if any man could better ad-\nvise him: and lastly, how religious he was without superstition. All these things of \nhim remember, that whensoever thy last hour shall come upon thee, it may find \nthee, as it did him, ready for it in the possession of a good conscience. \n\nXXIX.

What things soever are not within the proper power and jurisdiction of thine \nown will either to compass or avoid, if thou shalt propose unto thyself any of those \nthings as either good, or evil; it must needs be that according as thou shalt either fall \ninto that which thou dost think evil, or miss of that which thou dost think good, so \nwilt thou be ready both to complain of the Gods, and to hate those men, who either \nshall be so indeed, or shall by thee be suspected as the cause either of thy missing of \nthe one, or falling into the other. And indeed we must needs commit many evils, if we \nincline to any of these things, more or less, with an opinion of any difference. But if \nwe mind and fancy those things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our \nown wills, there is no more occasion why we should either murmur against the Gods, \nor be at enmity with any man. \n\nXXXVII. We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational apprehension of \nwhat we do: others without any such knowledge. As I think Heraclitus in a place \nspeaketh of them that sleep, that even they do work in their kind, and do confer to \nthe general operations of the world. One man therefore doth co-operate after one \nsort, and another after another sort; but even he that doth murmur, and to his pow-\ner doth resist and hinder; even he as much as any doth co-operate. For of such also \ndid the world stand in need. Now do thou consider among which of these thou wilt \nrank thyself. For as for him who is the Administrator of all, he will make good use of \nthee whether thou wilt or no, and make thee (as a part and member of the whole) so \nto co-operate with him, that whatsoever thou doest, shall turn to the furtherance of \nhis own counsels, and resolutions. But be not thou for shame such a part of the \nwhole, as that vile and ridiculous verse (which Chrysippus in a place doth mention)\n\n23 \n\nis a part of the comedy. \n\nXXXVIII. Doth either the sun take upon him to do that which belongs to the rain? or \nhis son Aesculapius that, which unto the earth doth properly belong? How is it with \nevery one of the stars in particular? Though they all differ one from another, and \nhave their several charges and functions by themselves, do they not all nevertheless \nconcur and co-operate to one end? \n\nXXXIX. If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular of those things that \nshould happen unto me, I must stand to their deliberation, as discrete and wise. For \nthat a God should be an imprudent God, is a thing hard even to conceive: and why \nshould they resolve to do me hurt? for what profit either unto them or the universe \n(which they specially take care for) could arise from it? But if so be that they have \nnot deliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in general, and \nthose things which in consequence and coherence of this general deliberation hap-\npen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace and accept of. But if so be that \nthey have not deliberated at all (which indeed is very irreligious for any man to be-\nlieve: for then let us neither sacrifice, nor pray, nor respect our oaths, neither let us \nany more use any of those things, which we persuaded of the presence and secret \n                                            \n23 [“Chrysippus” (42): C. refers to a passage of Plutarch De Communibus Notitiis (c. xiv.), where Chrysippus is \nrepresented as saying that a coarse phrase may be vile in itself, yet have due place in a comedy as contributing \nto a certain effect.] \n"

Now that unto every one is \nmost profitable, which is according to his own constitution and nature. And my na-\nture is, to be rational in all my actions and as a good, and natural member of a city \nand commonwealth, towards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly dis-\nposed and affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the \nwhole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to those cities, \nare the only things that are good and expedient for me. \n\nXL. Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the whole. And \nthus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient for the whole in general. \nBut yet this also shalt thou generally perceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that \nwhatsoever doth happen to any one man or men. . . . \n\n24 And now I am content that \n\nthe word expedient, should more generally be understood of those things which we \notherwise call middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the like. \n\nXLI.

For all things, above and below, are still the same, and from the \nsame causes. When then will there be an end? \n\nXLII.

Pass now to other generations. \nThither shall we after many changes, where so many brave orators are; where so \nmany grave philosophers; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where so many heroes of \nthe old times; and then so many brave captains of the latter times; and so many \nkings. After all these, where Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes; where so many oth-\ner sharp, generous, industrious, subtile, peremptory dispositions; and among others, \neven they, that have been the greatest scoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity \nof this our human life; as Menippus, and others, as many as there have been such \nas he. Of all these consider, that they long since are all dead, and gone. And what do \nthey suffer by it! Nay they that have not so much as a name remaining, what are \nthey the worse for it? One thing there is, and that only, which is worth our while in \nthis world, and ought by us much to be esteemed; and that is, according to truth \nand righteousness, meekly and lovingly to converse with false, and unrighteous men. \n\nXLIII. When thou wilt comfort and cheer thyself, call to mind the several gifts and vir-\ntues of them, whom thou dost daily converse with; as for example, the industry of \nthe one; the modesty of another; the liberality of a third; of another some other thing. \nFor nothing can so much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several \n\n                                            \n24 [“Man or men . . .” (45).

But if so be that I and my children be ne-\nglected by the gods, there is some reason even for that, &c. As long as right and equi-\nty is of my side, &c. Not to lament with them, not to tremble, &c”\n\n29 \n\nXXVI. Out of Plato. “My answer, full of justice and equity, should be this: Thy speech \nis not right, O man! if thou supposest that he that is of any worth at all, should ap-\nprehend either life or death, as a matter of great hazard and danger; and should not \nmake this rather his only care, to examine his own actions, whether just or unjust: \nwhether actions of a good, or of a wicked man, &c. For thus in very truth stands the \ncase, O ye men of Athens. What place or station soever a man either hath chosen to \nhimself, judging it best for himself; or is by lawful authority put and settled in, there-\nin do I think (all appearance of danger notwithstanding) that he should continue, as \none who feareth neither death, nor anything else, so much as he feareth to commit \nanything that is vicious and shameful, &c. But, O noble sir,\n\n30 consider I pray, \n\nwhether true generosity and true happiness, do not consist in somewhat else rather, \nthan in the preservation either of our, or other men’s lives. For it is not the part of a \nman that is a man indeed, to desire to live long or to make much of his life whilst he \nliveth: but rather (he that is such) will in these things wholly refer himself unto the \nGods, and believing that which every woman can tell him, that no man can escape \ndeath; the only thing that he takes thought and care for is this, that what time he \nliveth, he may live as well and as virtuously as he can possibly, &c. To look about, \nand with the eyes to follow the course of the stars and planets as though thou \nwouldst run with them; and to mind perpetually the several changes of the elements \none into another. For such fancies and imaginations, help much to purge away the \ndross and filth of this our earthly life,” &c. That also is a fine passage of Plato’s, \nwhere he speaketh of worldly things in these words: “Thou must also as from some \nhigher place look down, as it were, upon the things of this world, as flocks, armies, \nhusbandmen’s labours, marriages, divorces, generations, deaths: the tumults of \ncourts and places of judicatures; desert places; the several nations of barbarians, \npublic festivals, mournings, fairs, markets.” How all things upon earth are pell-mell; \nand how miraculously things contrary one to another, concur to the beauty and per-\nfection of this universe. \n\nXXVII. To look back upon things of former ages, as upon the manifold changes and \nconversions of several monarchies and commonwealths. We may also foresee things \nfuture, for they shall all be of the same kind; neither is it possible that they should \nleave the tune, or break the concert that is now begun, as it were, by these things \nthat are now done and brought to pass in the world. It comes all to one therefore, \nwhether a man be a spectator of the things of this life but forty years, or whether he \nsee them ten thousand years together: for what shall he see more? “And as for those \nparts that came from the earth, they shall return unto the earth again; and those \n\n                                            \n29 [“It will,” etc. (38): Euripides, Bellerophon, frag. 287 (Nauck). \n\n“Lives,” etc. (40): Euripides, Hypsipyle, frag. 757 (Nauck). \n“As long,” etc. (42): Aristophanes, Acharnæ, 66 I. \n“Plato” (44): Apology, p. 28 B. \n“For thus” (45): Apology, p. 28 E.] \n\n30 [“But, O noble sir,” etc. (46): Plato, Gorgias, 512 D.] \n"

Doth he bear all adverse chances with more \nequanimity: or with his neighbour’s offences with more meekness and gentleness \nthan I? \n\nXXIX. Where the matter may be effected agreeably to that reason, which both unto \nthe Gods and men is common, there can be no just cause of grief or sorrow. For \nwhere the fruit and benefit of an action well begun and prosecuted according to the \nproper constitution of man may be reaped and obtained, or is sure and certain, it is \nagainst reason that any damage should there be suspected. In all places, and at all \ntimes, it is in thy power religiously to embrace whatsoever by God’s appointment is \nhappened unto thee, and justly to converse with those men, whom thou hast to do \nwith, and accurately to examine every fancy that presents itself, that nothing may \nslip and steal in, before thou hast rightly apprehended the true nature of it. \n\nXXX. Look not about upon other men’s minds and understandings; but look right on \nforwards whither nature, both that of the universe, in those things that happen unto \nthee; and thine in particular, in those things that are done by thee: doth lead, and \ndirect thee. Now every one is bound to do that, which is consequent and agreeable to \nthat end which by his true natural constitution he was ordained unto. As for all oth-\ner things, they are ordained for the use of reasonable creatures: as in all things we \nsee that that which is worse and inferior, is made for that which is better. Reasona-\nble creatures, they are ordained one for another. That therefore which is chief in eve-\nry man’s constitution, is, that he intend the common good. The second is, that he \nyield not to any lusts and motions of the flesh. For it is the part and privilege of the \nreasonable and intellective faculty, that she can so bound herself, as that neither the \nsensitive, nor the appetitive faculties, may not anyways prevail upon her. For both \nthese are brutish. And therefore over both she challengeth mastery, and cannot an-\nyways endure, if in her right temper, to be subject unto either. And this indeed most \njustly. For by nature she was ordained to command all in the body. The third thing \nproper to man by his constitution, is, to avoid all rashness and precipitancy; and not \nto be subject to error. To these things then, let the mind apply herself and go straight \non, without any distraction about other things, and she hath her end, and by conse-\nquent her happiness. \n\nXXXI. As one who had lived, and were now to die by right, whatsoever is yet remain-\ning, bestow that wholly as a gracious overplus upon a virtuous life. Love and affect \nthat only, whatsoever it be that happeneth, and is by the fates appointed unto thee. \nFor what can be more reasonable? And as anything doth happen unto thee by way of \n\n                                            \n31 [“And as for those parts,” etc. (50): A quotation from Euripides, Chrysippus, frag. 839 (Nauck).] \n\n32 [“With meats,” etc. (51): From Euripides, Supplices, 1110.] \n"

Or rather leaving to men of the \nworld (whose life both in regard of themselves, and them that they converse with, is \nnothing but mere mutability; or men of as fickle minds, as fickle bodies; ever chang-\ning and soon changed themselves: let it be thine only care and study, how to make a \nright use of all such accidents. For there is good use to be made of them, and they \nwill prove fit matter for thee to work upon, if it shall be both thy care and thy desire, \nthat whatsoever thou doest, thou thyself mayst like and approve thyself for it.

Such a fountain, where springing waters can never fail, so thou dig still deeper \nand deeper. \n\nXXXII. Thou must use thyself also to keep thy body fixed and steady; free from all \nloose fluctuant either motion, or posture. And as upon thy face and looks, thy mind \nhath easily power over them to keep them to that which is grave and decent; so let it \nchallenge the same power over the whole body also. But so observe all things in this \nkind, as that it be without any manner of affectation. \n\nXXXIII. The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler’s, than a dancer’s \npractice. For in this they both\n\n33 agree, to teach a man whatsoever falls upon him, \n\nthat he may be ready for it, and that nothing may cast him down. \n\nXXXIV. Thou must continually ponder and consider with thyself, what manner of \nmen they be, and for their minds and understandings what is their present estate, \nwhose good word and testimony thou dost desire. For then neither wilt thou see \ncause to complain of them that offend against their wills; or find any want of their \napplause, if once thou dost but penetrate into the true force and ground both of their \nopinions, and of their desires. “No soul (saith he) is willingly bereft of the truth,” and \nby consequent, neither of justice, or temperance, or kindness, and mildness; nor of \nanything that is of the same kind. It is most needful that thou shouldst always re-\nmember this. For so shalt thou be far more gentle and moderate towards all men. \n\nXXXV. What pain soever thou art in, let this presently come to thy mind, that it is \nnot a thing whereof thou needest to be ashamed, neither is it a thing whereby thy \nunderstanding, that hath the government of all, can be made worse. For neither in \nregard of the substance of it, nor in regard of the end of it (which is, to intend the \ncommon good) can it alter and corrupt it. This also of Epicurus mayst thou in most \npains find some help of, that it is “neither intolerable, nor eternal”; so thou keep thy-\nself to the true bounds and limits of reason and give not way to opinion. This also \nthou must consider, that many things there be, which oftentimes unsensibly trouble \nand vex thee, as not armed against them with patience, because they go not ordinari-\nly under the name of pains, which in very deed are of the same nature as pain; as to \nslumber unquietly, to suffer heat, to want appetite: when therefore any of these \n\n                                            \n33 [§ xxxiii. “They both,” i.e. life and wrestling. \n\n“Says he” (63): Plato, quoted by Epictetus, Arr. i. 28, 2 and 22.] \n"

Nor that he walked in the streets, with much gravity and majesty, \nas was objected unto him by his adversaries: which nevertheless a man may well \ndoubt of, whether it were so or no, or, which above all the rest, if so be that it were \ntrue, a man would well consider of, whether commendable, or discommendable. The \nthing therefore that we must inquire into, is this; what manner of soul Socrates had: \nwhether his disposition was such; as that all that he stood upon, and sought after in \nthis world, was barely this, that he might ever carry himself justly towards men, and \nholily towards the Gods. Neither vexing himself to no purpose at the wickedness of \nothers, nor yet ever condescending to any man’s evil fact, or evil intentions, through \neither fear, or engagement of friendship. Whether of those things that happened unto \nhim by God’s appointment, he neither did wonder at any when it did happen, or \nthought it intolerable in the trial of it. And lastly, whether he never did suffer his \nmind to sympathise with the senses, and affections of the body. For we must not \nthink that Nature hath so mixed and tempered it with the body, as that she hath not \npower to circumscribe herself, and by herself to intend her own ends and occasions. \n\nXXXVIII. For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very divine man, and \nyet be altogether unknown. This thou must ever be mindful of, as of this also, that a \nman’s true happiness doth consist in very few things. And that although thou dost \ndespair, that thou shalt ever be a good either logician, or naturalist, yet thou art nev-\ner the further off by it from being either liberal, or modest, or charitable, or obedient \nunto God. \n\nXXXIX. Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou mayst run out \nthy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so much, and the wild \nbeasts should pull in sunder the poor members of thy pampered mass of flesh. For \nwhat in either of these or the like cases should hinder the mind to retain her own \nrest and tranquillity, consisting both in the right judgment of those things that hap-\npen unto her, and in the ready use of all present matters and occasions? So that her \njudgment may say, to that which is befallen her by way of cross: this thou art in very \ndeed, and according to thy true nature: notwithstanding that in the judgment of \nopinion thou dust appear otherwise: and her discretion to the present object; thou \nart that, which I sought for.

Now if it be no wonder that a man should have such and such opin-\nions, how can it be a wonder that he should do such and such things?

And so must thou reason with thyself, both in \nmatter of fame, and in matter of death. For as for the body itself, (the subject of \ndeath) wouldest thou know the vileness of it?

Oil, sweat, filth; or the sordes of the body: an excrementitious \nviscosity, the excrements of oil and other ointments used about the body, and mixed \nwith the sordes of the body: all base and loathsome.

Those austere ones I mean, such as were Charax, and Demetri-\nus the Platonic, and Eudaemon, and others like unto those. They were all but for one \nday; all dead and gone long since.

That \nwhich is most proper unto a man, is, first, to he kindly affected towards them that \nare of the same kind and nature as he is himself to contemn all sensual motions and \nappetites, to discern rightly all plausible fancies and imaginations, to contemplate \nthe nature of the universe; both it, and things that are done in it. In which kind of \ncontemplation three several relations are to be observed The first, to the apparent \nsecondary cause. The Second to the first original cause, God, from whom originally \nproceeds whatsoever doth happen in the world. The third and last, to them that we \nlive and converse with: what use may be made of it, to their use and benefit. \n\nXXVI. If pain be an evil, either it is in regard of the body; (and that cannot be, be-\ncause the body of itself is altogether insensible): or in regard of the soul But it is in \nthe power of the soul, to preserve her own peace and tranquillity, and not to suppose \nthat pain is evil.

And so likewise, \nwhatsoever is a hindrance unto the mind and understanding, must needs be the \nproper evil of the reasonable nature. Now apply all those things unto thyself. Do ei-\nther pain or pleasure seize on thee? Let the senses look to that. Hast thou met with \nSome obstacle or other in thy purpose and intention? If thou didst propose without \ndue reservation and exception now hath thy reasonable part received a blow indeed \nBut if in general thou didst propose unto thyself what soever might be, thou art not \nthereby either hurt, nor properly hindered.

As for me, this is my joy , if my understand-\ning be right and sound, as neither averse from any man, nor refusing any of those \nthings which as a man I am) subject unto; if I can look upon all things in the world \nmeekly and kindly; accept all things and carry myself towards everything according \nto true worth of the thing itself. \n\nXLII.

They that rather hunt \nfor fame after death, do not consider, that those men that shall be hereafter, will be \neven such, as these whom now they can so hardly bear with.

As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to a stone, which is not inci-\ndental unto them; unto every one in his own kind. If therefore nothing can happen \nunto anything, which is not both usual and natural; why art thou displeased? Sure \nthe common nature of all would not bring anything upon any, that were intolerable. \nIf therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that \nproperly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: \nwhich thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.

And yet those men, it is not for want of a place where to throw them that they \nkeep them in their shops for a while: but the nature of the universe hath no such \nout-place; but herein doth consist the wonder of her art and skill, that she having \nonce circumscribed herself within some certain bounds and limits, whatsoever is \nwithin her that seems either corrupted, or old, or unprofitable, she can change it into \nherself, and of these very things can make new things; so that she needeth not to \nseek elsewhere out of herself either for a new supply of matter and substance, or for \na place where to throw out whatsoever is irrecoverably putrid and corrupt. Thus she, \nas for place, so for matter and art, is herself sufficient unto herself. \n\nXLIX. Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy actions; nor conten-\ntious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to rove and wander in thy fancies \nand imaginations.

For therefore are the beams of it \ncalled ακτίνες from the word εκτείνεσθαι, to be stretched out and extended. Now what \na sunbeam is, thou mayest know if thou observe the light of the sun, when through \nsome narrow hole it pierceth into some room that is dark. For it is always in a direct \nline. And as by any solid body, that it meets with in the way that is not penetrable by \nair, it is divided and abrupted, and yet neither slides off, or falls down, but stayeth \nthere nevertheless: such must the diffusion in the mind be; not an effusion, but an \nextension. What obstacles and impediments soever she meeteth within her way, she \nmust not violently, and by way of an impetuous onset light upon them; neither must \nshe fall down; but she must stand, and give light unto that which doth admit of it. \n"

For the nature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, \nand therefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which now is, to \nwhatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation of blood and kindred. She is \nalso called truth and is the first cause of all truths. He therefore that willingly and \nwittingly doth lie, is impious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he \nthat against his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe, and in \nthat striving with the nature of the world he doth in his particular, violate the general \norder of the world. For he doth no better than strive and war against it, who contrary \nto his own nature applieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had \nbefore furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the attainment of \nit; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able to discern that which is false \nfrom that which is true.

Again, he that feareth pains and crosses in this \nworld, feareth some of those things which some time or other must needs happen in \nthe world. And that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth af-\nter pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that which is unjust, and \nthat is manifestly impious. Now those things which unto nature are equally indiffer-\nent (for she had not created both, both pain and pleasure, if both had not been unto \nher equally indifferent): they that will live according to nature, must in those things \n(as being of the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent. \nWhosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and life; honour \nand dishonour, (which things nature in the administration of the world, indifferently \ndoth make use of), is not as indifferent, it is apparent that he is impious. When I say \nthat common nature doth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they \nhappen indifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary conse-\nquence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the world, according to \nthat first and ancient deliberation of Providence, by which she from some certain be-\nginning, did resolve upon the creation of such a world, conceiving then in her womb \nas it were some certain rational generative seeds and faculties of things future, \nwhether subjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many. \n\nII.

Now whatsoever partakes of some \ncommon thing, naturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of \none kind and nature with it.

Whatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the ele-\nmentary fire tend upwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, \nthat whatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily set on \nfire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common nature, naturally \ndoth as much and more long after his own kind. For by how much in its own nature \nit excels all other things, by so much more is it desirous to be joined and united unto \nthat, which is of its own nature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not \nlong been, but presently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of \nyoung ones, and a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable, \nyet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of union more \nstrong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more excellent nature, than either in \nplants, or stones, or trees. But among reasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, \nfriendships, families, public meetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truc-\nes. Now among them that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and plan-\nets, though by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them began \nsome mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to excellency in a high degree \nto affect unity, as that even in things so far distant, it could operate unto a mutual \nsympathy. But now behold, what is now come to pass. Those creatures that are rea-\nsonable, are now the only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and \ninclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things that are of \none kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to flow together. But though \nthey fly from nature, yet are they stopt in their course, and apprehended. Do they \nwhat they can, nature doth prevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it. \nFor sooner mayst thou find a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, than find a \nman that naturally can live by himself alone. \n\nVIII. Man, God, the world, every one in their kind, bear some fruits. All things have \ntheir proper time to bear. Though by custom, the word itself is in a manner become \nproper unto the vine, and the like, yet is it so nevertheless, as we have said. As for \nreason, that beareth both common fruit for the use of others; and peculiar, which \nitself doth enjoy. Reason is of a diffusive nature, what itself is in itself, it begets in \nothers, and so doth multiply. \n\nIX. Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not, remember that for \nthis use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness and goodness granted unto thee. \nThe Gods themselves are good unto such; yea and in some things, (as in matter of \nhealth, of wealth, of honour), are content often to further their endeavours: so good \nand gracious are they. And mightest thou not be so too? or, tell me, what doth hinder \nthee? \n\nX. Labour not as one to whom it is appointed to be wretched, nor as one that either \nwould be pitied, or admired; but let this be thine only care and desire; so always and \nin all things to prosecute or to forbear, as the law of charity, or mutual society doth \nrequire. \n\nXI. This day I did come out of all my trouble. Nay I have cast out all my trouble; it \nshould rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever it was, was not without \nanywhere that thou shouldest come out of it, but within in thine own opinions, from \nwhence it must be cast out, before thou canst truly and constantly be at ease. \n"

When at any time thou art offended with any one’s impudency, put presently \nthis question to thyself: “What? Is it then possible, that there should not be any im-\npudent men in the world! Certainly it is not possible.” Desire not then that which is \nimpossible. For this one, (thou must think) whosoever he be, is one of those impu-\ndent ones, that the world cannot be without. So of the subtile and crafty, so of the \nperfidious, so of every one that offendeth, must thou ever be ready to reason with \nthyself. For whilst in general thou dost thus reason with thyself, that the kind of \nthem must needs be in the world, thou wilt be the better able to use meekness to-\nwards every particular. This also thou shalt find of very good use, upon every such \noccasion, presently to consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath fur-\nnished man with, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious in \nthis kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meek-\nness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious in another kind some other pe-\nculiar faculty. And generally, is it not in thy power to instruct him better, that is in \nan error? For whosoever sinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is \ncertainly deceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin? For thou shalt not \nfind that any one of these, against whom thou art incensed, hath in very deed done \nanything whereby thy mind (the only true subject of thy hurt and evil) can be made \nworse than it was. And what a matter of either grief or wonder is this, if he that is \nunlearned, do the deeds of one that is unlearned?

And did nature then either of herself thus project and purpose the affliction and \nmisery of her parts, and therefore of purpose so made them, not only that haply they \nmight, but of necessity that they should fall into evil; or did not she know what she \ndid, when she made them? For either of these two to say, is equally absurd. But to \nlet pass nature in general, and to reason of things particular according to their own \nparticular natures; how absurd and ridiculous is it, first to say that all parts of the \nwhole are, by their proper natural constitution, subject to alteration; and then when \nany such thing doth happen, as when one doth fall sick and dieth, to take on and \nwonder as though some strange thing had happened? Though this besides might \nmove not so grievously to take on when any such thing doth happen, that whatsoev-\ner is dissolved, it is dissolved into those things, whereof it was compounded. For eve-\nry dissolution is either a mere dispersion, of the elements into those elements again \nwhereof everything did consist, or a change, of that which is more solid into earth; \nand of that which is pure and subtile or spiritual, into air. So that by this means \nnothing is lost, but all resumed again into those rational generative seeds of the uni-\nverse; and this universe, either after a certain period of time to lie consumed by fire, \nor by continual changes to be renewed, and so for ever to endure.

That therefore which thou hast since re-\nceived, not that which came from thy mother, is that which comes to change and \ncorruption. But suppose that that for the general substance, and more solid part of \nit, should still cleave unto thee never so close, yet what is that to the proper qualities \nand affections of it, by which persons are distinguished, which certainly are quite dif-\nferent? \n\nVIII. Now that thou hast taken these names upon thee of good, modest, true; of \nέμφρων, σύμφρων, υπέρφρων; take heed lest at any times by doing anything that is \ncontrary, thou be but improperly so called, and lose thy right to these appellations. \nOr if thou do, return unto them again with all possible speed. And remember, that \nthe word έμφρων notes unto thee an intent and intelligent consideration of every ob-\nject that presents itself unto thee, without distraction. And the word σύμφρων, a \nready and contented acceptation of whatsoever by the appointment of the common \nnature, happens unto thee. And the word υπέρφρων, a super-extension, or a trans-\ncendent, and outreaching disposition of thy mind, whereby it passeth by all bodily \npains and pleasures, honour and credit, death and whatsoever is of the same nature, \nas matters of absolute indifferency, and in no wise to be stood upon by a wise man. \nThese then if inviolably thou shalt observe, and shalt not be ambitious to be so called \nby others, both thou thyself shalt become a new man, and thou shalt begin a new \nlife. For to continue such as hitherto thou hast been, to undergo those distractions \nand distempers as thou must needs for such a life as hitherto thou hast lived, is the \npart of one that is very foolish, and is overfond of his life. Whom a man might com-\npare to one of those half-eaten wretches, matched in the amphitheatre with wild \nbeasts; who as full as they are all the body over with wounds and blood, desire for a \ngreat favour, that they may be reserved till the next day, then also, and in the same \nestate to be exposed to the same nails and teeth as before. Away therefore, ship thy-\nself; and from the troubles and distractions of thy former life convey thyself as it were \nunto these few names; and if thou canst abide in them, or be constant in the practice \nand possession of them, continue there as glad and joyful as one that were translat-\ned unto some such place of bliss and happiness as that which by Hesiod and Plato is \ncalled the Islands of the Blessed, by others called the Elysian Fields. And whensoever \nthou findest thyself; that thou art in danger of a relapse, and that thou art not able \nto master and overcome those difficulties and temptations that present themselves in \nthy present station: get thee into any private corner, where thou mayst be better \nable. Or if that will not serve forsake even thy life rather. But so that it be not in pas-\nsion but in a plain voluntary modest way: this being the only commendable action of \nthy whole life that thus thou art departed, or this having been the main work and \nbusiness of thy whole life, that thou mightest thus depart. Now for the better re-\nmembrance of those names that we have spoken of, thou shalt find it a very good \nhelp, to remember the Gods as often as may be: and that, the thing which they re-\nquire at our hands of as many of us, as are by nature reasonable creation is not that \n"

And contenting himself \nwith these two things, to do all things justly, and whatsoever God doth send to like \nwell of it: what others shall either say or think of him, or shall do against him, he \ndoth not so much as trouble his thoughts with it.

As for thy body, \n\nwhich as a vessel, or a case, compasseth thee about, and the many and curious in-\nstruments that it hath annexed unto it, let them not trouble thy thoughts. For of \nthemselves they are but as a carpenter’s axe, but that they are born with us, and \nnaturally sticking unto us. But otherwise, without the inward cause that hath power \nto move them, and to restrain them, those parts are of themselves of no more use \nunto us, than the shuttle is of itself to the weaver, or the pen to the writer, or the \nwhip to the coachman. \n\n                                            \n41 [“Rhetoric” (38): Rather “the gift of speech”; or perhaps the “decree” of the reasoning faculty.] \n"

Again; \nwhensoever, and wheresoever, sooner or later, her life doth end, she hath her own \nend nevertheless. For it is not with her, as with dancers and players, who if they be \ninterrupted in any part of their action, the whole action must needs be imperfect: but \nshe in what part of time or action soever she be surprised, can make that which she \nbath in her hand whatsoever it be, complete and full, so that she may depart with \nthat comfort, “I have lived; neither want I anything of that which properly did belong \nunto me.” Again, she compasseth the whole world, and penetrateth into the vanity, \nand mere outside (wanting substance and solidity) of it, and stretcheth herself unto \nthe infiniteness of eternity; and the revolution or restoration of all things after a cer-\ntain period of time, to the same state and place as before, she fetcheth about, and \ndoth comprehend in herself; and considers withal, and sees clearly this, that neither \nthey that shall follow us, shall see any new thing, that we have not seen, nor they \nthat went before, anything more than we: but that he that is once come to forty (if he \nhave any wit at all) can in a manner (for that they are all of one kind) see all things, \nboth past and future. As proper is it, and natural to the soul of man to love her \nneighbour, to be true and modest; and to regard nothing so much as herself: which \nis also the property of the law: whereby by the way it appears, that sound reason and \njustice comes all to one, and therefore that justice is the chief thing, that reasonable \ncreatures ought to propose unto themselves as their end. \n\nII.

What is \nthy profession? to be good. And how should this be well brought to pass, but by cer-\ntain theorems and doctrines; some Concerning the nature of the universe, and some \nConcerning the proper and particular constitution of man? \n\nV. Tragedies were at first brought in and instituted, to put men in mind of worldly \nchances and casualties: that these things in the ordinary course of nature did so \nhappen: that men that were much pleased and delighted by such accidents upon \nthis stage, would not by the same things in a greater stage be grieved and afflicted: \nfor here you see what is the end of all such things; and that even they that cry out so \nmournfully to Cithaeron,\n\n42 must bear them for all their cries and exclamations, as \n\nwell as others. And in very truth many good things are spoken by these poets; as \nthat (for example) is an excellent passage: “But if so be that I and my two children be \nneglected by the Gods, they have some reason even for that,” &c. And again, “It will \nbut little avail thee to storm and rage against the things themselves,” &c. Again, “To \nreap one’s life, as a ripe ear of corn”; and whatsoever else is to be found in them, that \nis of the same kind. After the tragedy, the ancient comedy was brought in, which had \nthe liberty to inveigh against personal vices; being therefore through this her freedom \nand liberty of speech of very good use and effect, to restrain men from pride and ar-\nrogancy. To which end it was, that Diogenes took also the same liberty. After these, \nwhat were either the Middle, or New Comedy\n\n43 admitted for, but merely, (Or for the \n\nmost part at least) for the delight and pleasure of curious and excellent imitation? “It \nwill steal away; look to it,” &c. Why, no man denies, but that these also have some \ngood things whereof that may be one: but the whole drift and foundation of that kind \nof dramatical poetry, what is it else, but as we have said? \n\nVI. How clearly doth it appear unto thee, that no other course of thy life could fit a \ntrue philosopher’s practice better, than this very course, that thou art now already \nin? \n\nVII. A branch cut off from the continuity of that which was next unto it, must needs \nbe cut off from the whole tree: so a man that is divided from another man, is divided \nfrom the whole society. A branch is cut off by another, but he that hates and is \naverse, cuts himself off from his neighbour, and knows not that at the same time he \ndivides himself from the whole body, or corporation. But herein is the gift and mercy \nof God, the Author of this society, in that, once cut off we may grow together and be-\ncome part of the whole again. But if this happen often the misery is that the further a \nman is run in this division, the harder he is to be reunited and restored again: and \nhowever the branch which, once cut of afterwards was graffed in, gardeners can tell \nyou is not like that which sprouted together at first, and still continued in the unity \nof the body. \n\n                                            \n42 [“Cithaeron” (6): Oedipus utters this cry after discovering that he has fulfilled his awful doom.

But be it thy care to keep thyself \nconstant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true meekness towards \nthem, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder thee, or at least will be dis-\npleased with thee for what thou hast done. For to fail in either (either in the one to \ngive over for fear, or in the other to forsake thy natural affection towards him, who by \nnature is both thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of \nthe disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier. \n\nIX. It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts \nimitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures \nshould in her operation come short of the skill of arts, is most improbable. Now \ncommon is it to all arts, to make that which is worse for the better’s sake. Much \nmore then doth the common nature do the same. Hence is the first ground of justice. \nFrom justice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be preserved, if \neither we settle our minds and affections upon worldly things; or be apt to be de-\nceived, or rash, and inconstant. \n\nX. The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put to so much \ntrouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner goest unto them. Let \nthen thine own judgment and opinion concerning those things be at rest; and as for \nthe things themselves, they stand still and quiet, without any noise or stir at all; and \nso shall all pursuing and flying cease. \n\nXI. Then is the soul as Empedocles doth liken it, like unto a sphere or globe, when \nshe is all of one form and figure: when she neither greedily stretcheth out herself un-\nto anything, nor basely contracts herself, or lies flat and dejected; but shineth all \nwith light, whereby she does see and behold the true nature, both that of the uni-\nverse, and her own in particular. \n\nXII.

Will any hate me? let him look to that. I for my part will be \nkind and loving unto all, and even unto him that hates me, whomsoever he be, will I \nbe ready to show his error, not by way of exprobation or ostentation of my patience, \nbut ingenuously and meekly: such as was that famous Phocion,\n\n44 if so be that he did \n\nnot dissemble. For it is inwardly that these things must be: that the Gods who look \ninwardly, and not upon the outward appearance, may behold a man truly free from \nall indignation and grief. For what hurt can it be unto thee whatsoever any man else \ndoth, as long as thou mayest do that which is proper and suitable to thine own na-\nture?

O man, what doest thou mean! \nwhat needs this profession of thine? the thing itself will show it. It ought to be writ-\nten upon thy forehead. No sooner thy voice is heard, than thy countenance must be \nable to show what is in thy mind: even as he that is loved knows presently by the \nlooks of his sweetheart what is in her mind. Such must he be for all the world, that \nis truly simple and good, as he whose arm-holes are offensive, that whosoever stands \nby, as soon as ever he comes near him, may as it were smell him whether he will or \nno. But the affectation of simplicity is nowise laudable. There is nothing more \nshameful than perfidious friendship. Above all things, that must be avoided. However \ntrue goodness, simplicity, and kindness cannot so be hidden, but that as we have \nalready said in the very eyes and countenance they will show themselves. \n\nXV. To live happily is an inward power of the soul, when she is affected with indiffer-\nency, towards those things that are by their nature indifferent. To be thus affected \nshe must consider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembering withal \nthat no object can of itself beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but \nstands without still and quiet; but that we ourselves beget, and as it were print in \nourselves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our power, not to print them; and if \nthey creep in and lurk in some corner, it is in our power to wipe them off. Remember-\ning moreover, that this care and circumspection of thine, is to continue but for a \nwhile, and then thy life will be at an end. And what should hinder, but that thou \nmayest do well with all these things? For if they be according to nature, rejoice in \nthem, and let them be pleasing and acceptable unto thee. But if they be against na-\nture, seek thou that which is according to thine own nature, and whether it be for \nthy credit or no, use all possible speed for the attainment of it: for no man ought to \nbe blamed, for seeking his own good and happiness. \n\nXVI. Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what things it doth \nconsist, and into what it will be changed: what will be the nature of it, or what it will \nbe like unto when it is changed; and that it can suffer no hurt by this change. And as \nfor other men’s either foolishness or wickedness, that it may not trouble and grieve \nthee; first generally thus; What reference have I unto these? and that we are all born \nfor one another’s good: then more particularly after another consideration; as a ram \nis first in a flock of sheep, and a bull in a herd of cattle, so am I born to rule over \nthem. Begin yet higher, even from this: if atoms be not the beginning of all things, \nthan which to believe nothing can be more absurd, then must we needs grant that \nthere is a nature, that doth govern the universe. If such a nature, then are all worse \nthings made for the better’s sake; and all better for one another’s sake. Secondly, \nwhat manner of men they be, at board, and upon their beds, and so forth. But above \nall things, how they are forced by their opinions that they hold, to do what they do; \nand even those things that they do, with what pride and self-conceit they do them. \nThirdly, that if they do these things rightly, thou hast no reason to be grieved.

There-\nfore are they grieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice, \nor unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious kind of deal-\ning towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself doest transgress in many \nthings, and art even such another as they are. And though perchance thou doest \nforbear the very act of some sins, yet hast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to \nthem, but that either through fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious fool-\nish respect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or no, thou \ndoest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by way of discreet policy; \nand generally a man must know many things first, before he be able truly and judi-\nciously to judge of another man’s action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on \ngrievously, or makest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man’s life is \nbut for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our graves. Sev-\nenthly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly; \nfor they have their existence in their minds and understandings only, that commit \nthem; but our own opinions concerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to \npart with that conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed \nthine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself that it is not \nshameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only true evil that is, thou also \nwilt be driven whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature, to avoid that \nwhich is evil, to commit many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, \nthat will make to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many \nthings may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief; far more \ngrievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so grieved or angry for. \nNinthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable, if it be true and natural, and not \naffected or hypocritical. For how shall even the most fierce and malicious that thou \nshalt conceive, be able to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and \nloving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do thee wrong, thou \nshalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all meekness to teach him, and to \ninstruct him better? As for example; My son, we were not born for this, to hurt and \nannoy one another; it will be thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly \nand fully, that it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another, nor \nany other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must do, not scoffingly, \nnot by way of exprobation, but tenderly without any harshness of words. Neither \nmust thou do it by way of exercise, or ostentation, that they that are by and hear \nthee, may admire thee: but so always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: \nyea, though there be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as \nso many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one day, \nwhilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other side thou must take \nheed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with them: for both are equally unchar-\nitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy passions, take it presently to thy considera-\ntion, that to be angry is not the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it \nsavours of more humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength and \nnerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is altogether void.

Now for a man \nto brook well enough, that there should be wicked men in the world, but not to en-\ndure that any should transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed ty-\nrannical. \n\nXVII. Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and understand-\ning, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest \ndiscover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself concerning every one of \nthem, This imagination is not necessary; this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak \nas another man’s slave, or instrument; than which nothing can be more senseless \nand absurd: for the fourth, thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that \nthou doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become subject and obnoxious to \nthat more ignoble part of thy body, and the gross lusts and concupiscences thereof. \n\nXVIII.

So whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or humid, alt-\nhough by nature it tend downwards, yet is it against its nature both raised upwards, \nand standing, or consistent. So obedient are even the elements themselves to the \nuniverse, abiding patiently wheresoever (though against their nature) they are \nplaced, until the sound as it were of their retreat, and separation. Is it not a grievous \nthing then, that thy reasonable part only should be disobedient, and should not en-\ndure to keep its place: yea though it be nothing enjoined that is contrary unto it, but \nthat only which is according to its nature? For we cannot say of it when it is disobe-\ndient, as we say of the fire, or air, that it tends upwards towards its proper element, \nfor then goes it the quite contrary way. For the motion of the mind to any injustice, \nor incontinency, or to sorrow, or to fear, is nothing else but a separation from nature. \nAlso when the mind is grieved for anything that is happened by the divine provi-\ndence, then doth it likewise forsake its own place. For it was ordained unto holiness \nand godliness, which specially consist in an humble submission to God and His \nprovidence in all things; as well as unto justice: these also being part of those duties, \nwhich as naturally sociable, we are bound unto; and without which we cannot happi-\nly converse one with another: yea and the very ground and fountain indeed of all just \nactions. \n\nXIX. He that hath not one and the self-same general end always as long as he liveth, \ncannot possibly be one and the self-same man always. But this will not suffice except \nthou add also what ought to be this general end. For as the general conceit and ap-\nprehension of all those things which upon no certain ground are by the greater part \nof men deemed good, cannot be uniform and agreeable, but that only which is lim-\nited and restrained by some certain proprieties and conditions, as of community: \nthat nothing be conceived good, which is not commonly and publicly good: so must \nthe end also that we propose unto ourselves, be common and sociable.

If therefore \nwhensoever the time of thy departing shall come, thou shalt readily leave all things, \nand shalt respect thy mind only, and that divine part of thine, and this shall be thine \nonly fear, not that some time or other thou shalt cease to live, but thou shalt never \nbegin to live according to nature: then shalt thou be a man indeed, worthy of that \nworld, from which thou hadst thy beginning; then shalt thou cease to be a stranger \nin thy country, and to wonder at those things that happen daily, as things strange \nand unexpected, and anxiously to depend of divers things that are not in thy power. \n\nII. God beholds our minds and understandings, bare and naked from these material \nvessels, and outsides, and all earthly dross. For with His simple and pure under-\nstanding, He pierceth into our inmost and purest parts, which from His, as it were by \na water pipe and channel, first flowed and issued. This if thou also shalt use to do, \nthou shalt rid thyself of that manifold luggage, wherewith thou art round about en-\ncumbered. For he that does regard neither his body, nor his clothing, nor his dwell-\ning, nor any such external furniture, must needs gain unto himself great rest and \nease. Three things there be in all, which thou doest consist of; thy body, thy life, and \nthy mind. Of these the two former, are so far forth thine, as that thou art bound to \ntake care for them. But the third alone is that which is properly thine. If then thou \nshalt separate from thyself, that is from thy mind, whatsoever other men either do or \nsay, or whatsoever thou thyself hast heretofore either done or said; and all trouble-\nsome thoughts concerning the future, and whatsoever, (as either belonging to thy \nbody or life): is without the jurisdiction of thine own will, and whatsoever in the ordi-\nnary course of human chances and accidents doth happen unto thee; so that thy \nmind (keeping herself loose and free from all outward coincidental entanglements; \nalways in a readiness to depart): shall live by herself, and to herself, doing that which \nis just, accepting whatsoever doth happen, and speaking the truth always; if, I say, \nthou shalt separate from thy mind, whatsoever by sympathy might adhere unto it, \nand all time both past and future, and shalt make thyself in all points and respects, \nlike unto Empedocles his allegorical sphere, “all round and circular,” &c., and shalt \nthink of no longer life than that which is now present: then shalt thou be truly able \nto pass the remainder of thy days without troubles and distractions; nobly and gen-\nerously disposed, and in good favour and correspondency, with that spirit which is \nwithin thee. \n"

For \nif any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing \nby himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, \nthough but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, \nthan what we ourselves. \n\nIV. How come it to pass that the Gods having ordered all other things so well and so \nlovingly, should be overseen in this one only thing, that whereas then. hath been \nsome very good men that have made many covenants as it were with God and by \nmany holy actions and outward services contracted a kind of familiarity with Him; \nthat these men when once they are dead, should never be restored to life, but be ex-\ntinct for ever. But this thou mayest be sure of, that this (if it be so indeed) would \nnever have been so ordered by the Gods, had it been fit otherwise. For certainly it \nwas possible, had it been more just so and had it been according to nature, the na-\nture of the universe would easily have borne it. But now because it is not so, (if so be \nthat it be not so indeed) be therefore confident that it was not fit it should be so. for \nthou seest thyself, that now seeking after this matter, how freely thou doest argue \nand contest with God. But were not the Gods both just and good in the highest de-\ngree, thou durst not thus reason with them. Now if just and good, it could not be \nthat in the creation of the world, they should either unjustly or unreasonably oversee \nanything. \n\nV. Use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair of. For the left \nhand we see, which for the most part lieth idle because not used; yet doth it hold the \nbridle with more strength than the right, because it hath been used unto it. \n\nVI. Let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation: to consider, what manner of \nmen both for soul and body we ought to be, whensoever death shall surprise us: the \nshortness of this our mortal life: the immense vastness of the time that hath been \nbefore, and will he after us: the frailty of every worldly material object: all these \nthings to consider, and behold clearly in themselves, all disguisement of external \noutside being removed and taken away. Again, to consider the efficient causes of all \nthings: the proper ends and references of all actions: what pain is in itself; what \npleasure, what death: what fame or honour, how every man is the true and proper \nground of his own rest and tranquillity, and that no man can truly be hindered by \nany other: that all is but conceit and opinion. As for the use of thy dogmata, thou \nmust carry thyself in the practice of them, rather like unto a pancratiastes, or one \nthat at the same time both fights and wrestles with hands and feet, than a gladiator. \nFor this, if he lose his sword that he fights with, he is gone: whereas the other hath \nstill his hand free, which he may easily turn and manage at his will. \n\nVII. All worldly things thou must behold and consider, dividing them into matter, \nform, and reference, or their proper end. \n\nVIII. How happy is man in this his power that hath been granted unto him: that he \nneeds not do anything but what God shall approve, and that he may embrace con-\ntentedly, whatsoever God doth send unto him? \n"

None then must be \naccused. \n\nX. How ridiculous and strange is he, that wonders at anything that happens in this \nlife in the ordinary course of nature! \n\nXI. Either fate, (and that either an absolute necessity, and unavoidable decree; or a \nplacable and flexible Providence) or all is a mere casual confusion, void of all order \nand government. If an absolute and unavoidable necessity, why doest thou resist? If \na placable and exorable Providence, make thyself worthy of the divine help and assis-\ntance. If all be a mere confusion without any moderator, or governor, then hast thou \nreason to congratulate thyself; that in such a general flood of confusion thou thyself \nhast obtained a reasonable faculty, whereby thou mayest govern thine own life and \nactions. But if thou beest carried away with the flood, it must be thy body perchance, \nor thy life, or some other thing that belongs unto them that is carried away: thy mind \nand understanding cannot. Or should it be so, that the light of a candle indeed is \nstill bright and lightsome until it be put out: and should truth, and righteousness, \nand temperance cease to shine in thee whilest thou thyself hast any being? \n\nXII. At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a one hath sinned, thus \nreason with thyself; What do I know whether this be a sin indeed, as it seems to be? \nBut if it be, what do I know but that he himself hath already condemned himself for \nit? And that is all one as if a man should scratch and tear his own face, an object of \ncompassion rather than of anger. Again, that he that would not have a vicious man \nto sin, is like unto him that would not have moisture in the fig, nor children to weep \nnor a horse to neigh, nor anything else that in the course of nature is necessary. For \nwhat shall he do that hath such an habit? If thou therefore beest powerful and elo-\nquent, remedy it if thou canst. \n\nXIII. If it be not fitting, do it not. If it be not true, speak it not. Ever maintain thine \nown purpose and resolution free from all compulsion and necessity. \n\nXIV.

It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in thee, better and \nmore divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual appetites and affections. What \nis now the object of my mind, is it fear, or suspicion, or lust, or any such thing? To \ndo nothing rashly without some certain end; let that be thy first care. The next, to \nhave no other end than the common good. For, alas! yet a little while, and thou art \nno more: no more will any, either of those things that now thou seest, or of those \nmen that now are living, be any more. For all things are by nature appointed soon to \nbe changed, turned, and corrupted, that other things might succeed in their room. \n\nXVI.

No operation whatsoever it he, ceasing for a while, can be truly said to suffer \nany evil, because it is at an end. Neither can he that is the author of that operation; \nfor this very respect, because his operation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. \nLikewise then, neither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in \ntime it cease, be said to suffer any evil for this very reason, because it is at an end; \nnor he truly be said to have been ill affected, that did put a period to this series of \nactions. Now this time or certain period, depends of the determination of nature: \nsometimes of particular nature, as when a man dieth old; but of nature in general, \nhowever; the parts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world still \ncontinues fresh and new. Now that is ever best and most seasonable, which is for the \ngood of the whole. Thus it appears that death of itself can neither be hurtful to any in \nparticular, because it is not a shameful thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of \nour own will, nor of itself contrary to the common good) and generally, as it is both \nexpedient and seasonable to the whole, that in that respect it must needs be good. It \nis that also, which is brought unto us by the order and appointment of the Divine \nProvidence; so that he whose will and mind in these things runs along with the Di-\nvine ordinance, and by this concurrence of his will and mind with the Divine Provi-\ndence, is led and driven along, as it were by God Himself; may truly be termed and \nesteemed the θεοφόρητος, or divinely led and inspired. \n\nXVIII. These three things thou must have always in a readiness: first concerning \nthine own actions, whether thou doest nothing either idly, or otherwise, than justice \nand equity do require: and concerning those things that happen unto thee externally, \nthat either they happen unto thee by chance, or by providence; of which two to ac-\ncuse either, is equally against reason. Secondly, what like unto our bodies are \nwhilest yet rude and imperfect, until they be animated: and from their animation, \nuntil their expiration: of what things they are compounded, and into what things \nthey shall be dissolved. Thirdly, how vain all things will appear unto thee when, from \non high as it were, looking down thou shalt contemplate all things upon earth, and \nthe wonderful mutability, that they are subject unto: considering withal, the infinite \nboth greatness and variety of things aerial and things celestial that are round about \nit. And that as often as thou shalt behold them, thou shalt still see the same: as the \nsame things, so the same shortness of continuance of all those things. And, behold, \nthese be the things that we are so proud and puffed up for. \n\nXIX. Cast away from thee opinion, and thou art safe. And what is it that hinders thee \nfrom casting of it away? When thou art grieved at anything, hast thou forgotten that \nall things happen according to the nature of the universe; and that him only it con-\ncerns, who is in fault; and moreover, that what is now done, is that which from ever \nhath been done in the world, and will ever be done, and is now done everywhere: how \nnearly all men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood, nor of seed, but of \nthe same mind. Thou hast also forgotten that every man’s mind partakes of the Dei-\nty, and issueth from thence; and that no man can properly call anything his own, no \nnot his son, nor his body, nor his life; for that they all proceed from that One who is \nthe giver of all things: that all things are but opinion; that no man lives properly, but \n"

Then consider what’s now become of all those things. All is \nturned to smoke; all to ashes, and a mere fable; and perchance not so much as a fa-\nble. As also whatsoever is of this nature, as Fabius Catulinus in the field; Lucius Lu-\npus, and Stertinius, at Baiæ; Tiberius at Capreæ: and Velius Rufus, and all such ex-\namples of vehement prosecution in worldly matters; let these also run in thy mind at \nthe same time; and how vile every object of such earnest and vehement prosecution \nis; and how much more agreeable to true philosophy it is, for a man to carry himself \nin every matter that offers itself; justly, and moderately, as one that followeth the \nGods with all simplicity.

And as for all other parts of those generals which we have mentioned, \nas either sensitive souls or subjects, these of themselves (as naturally irrational) have \nno common mutual reference one unto another, though many of them contain a \nmind, or reasonable faculty in them, whereby they are ruled and governed.

What a small portion of vast and infinite eternity it is, that is allowed unto eve-\nry one of us, and how soon it vanisheth into the general age of the world: of the \ncommon substance, and of the common soul also what a small portion is allotted un-\nto us: and in what a little clod of the whole earth (as it were) it is that thou doest \ncrawl.

CORNELIUS FRONTO \n\nM \n\n48 was a Roman by descent, but of provincial birth, be-\n\nCORNELIUS FRONTO\n\ning native to Cirta, in Numidia. Thence he migrated to Rome in the reign of \nHadrian, and became the most famous rhetorician of his day. As a pleader \n\nand orator he was counted by his contemporaries hardly inferior to Tully himself, \nand as a teacher his aid was sought for the noblest youths of Rome. To him was en-\ntrusted the education of M. Aurelius and of his colleague L. Verus in their boyhood; \nand he was rewarded for his efforts by a seat in the Senate and the consular rank \n(A.D. 143). By the exercise of his profession he became wealthy; and if he speaks of \nhis means as not great,\n\n49 he must be comparing his wealth with the grandees of \n\nRome, not with the ordinary citizen. \n\nBefore the present century nothing was known of the works of Fronto, except a \ngrammatical treatise; but in 1815 Cardinal Mai published a number of letters and \nsome short essays of Fronto, which he had discovered in a palimpsest at Milan. Oth-\ner parts of the same MS. he found later in the Vatican, the whole being collected and \nedited in the year 1823. We now possess parts of his correspondence with Antoninus \nPius, with M. Aurelius, with L. Verus, and with certain of his friends, and also sever-\nal rhetorical and historical fragments. Though none of the more ambitious works of \nFronto have survived, there are enough to give proof of his powers. Never was a great \nliterary reputation less deserved. It would be bard to conceive of anything more vapid \nthan the style and conception of these letters; clearly the man was a pedant without \nimagination or taste. Such indeed was the age he lived in, and it is no marvel that he \nwas like to his age. But there must have been more in him than mere pedantry; there \nwas indeed a heart in the man, which Marcus found, arid he found also a tongue \nwhich could speak the truth. Fronto’s letters are by no means free from exaggeration \nand laudation, but they do not show that loathsome flattery which filled the Roman \ncourt. He really admires what he praises, and his way of saying so is not unlike what \noften passes for criticism at the present day. He is not afraid to reprove what he \nthinks amiss; and the astonishment of Marcus at this will prove, if proof were need-\ned, that he was not used to plain dealing. “How happy I am,” he writes, “that my \nfriend Marcus Cornelius, so distinguished as an orator and so noble as a man, \nthinks me worth praising and blaming.”\n\n50 In another place he deems himself blest \n\n51 although the context shows \n\nbecause Pronto had taught him to speak the truth;\n\nhim to be speaking of expression, it is still a point in favour of Pronto. A sincere heart \nis better than literary taste; and if Fronto had not done his duty by the young prince, \n\n                                            \n48 References are made to the edition of Naber, Leipzig (Trübner), 1867. \n\n49 Ad Verum Imp.

            "text": "it is not easy to understand the friendship which remained between them up to the \nlast. \n\nAn example of the frankness which was between them is given by a difference they \nhad over the case of Herodes Atticus. Herodes was a Greek rhetorician who had a \nschool at Rome, and Marcus Aurelius was among his pupils. Both Marcus and the \nEmperor Antoninus had a high opinion of Herodes; and all we know goes to prove he \nwas a man of high character and princely generosity. When quite young he was made \nadministrator of the free cities in Asia, nor is it surprising to find that he made bitter \nenemies there; indeed, a just ruler was sure to make enemies. The end of it was that \nan Athenian deputation, headed by the orators Theodotus and Demostratus, made \nserious accusations against his honour. There is no need to discuss the merits of the \ncase here; suffice it to say, Herodes succeeded in defending himself to the satisfac-\ntion of the emperor. Pronto appears to have taken the delegates’ part, and to have \naccepted a brief for the prosecution, urged to some extent by personal considera-\ntions; and in this cause Marcus Aurelius writes to Fronto as follows: \n\n52 \n\n“AURELIUS CÆSAR to his friend FRONTO, greeting.\n\n“I know you have often told me you were anxious to find how you might best \nplease me. Now is the time; now you can increase my love towards you, if it can \nbe increased. A trial is at hand, in which people seem likely not only to hear \nyour speech with pleasure, but to see your indignation with impatience. I see \nno one who dares give you a hint in the matter; for those who are less friendly, \nprefer to see you act with some inconsistency; and those who are more friendly, \nfear to seem too friendly to your opponent if they should dissuade you from \nyour accusation; then again, in case you have prepared something neat for the \noccasion, they cannot endure to rob you of your harangue by silencing you. \nTherefore, whether you think me a rash counsellor, or a bold boy, or too kind to \nyour opponent, not because I think it better, I will offer my counsel with some \ncaution. But why have I said, offer my counsel? No, I demand it from you; I \ndemand it boldly, and if I succeed, I promise to remain under your obligation. \nWhat? you will say if I am attackt, shall I not pay tit for tat? Ah, but you will get \ngreater glory, if even when attackt you answer nothing. Indeed, if he begins it, \nanswer as you will and you will have fair excuse; but I have demanded of him \nthat he shall not begin, and I think I have succeeded. I love each of you accord-\ning to your merits and I know that lie was educated in the house of P. Calvisi-\nus, my grandfather, and that I was educated by you; therefore I am full of anxi-\nety that this most disagreeable business shall be managed as honourably as \npossible. I trust you may approve my advice, for my intention you will approve. \nAt least I prefer to write unwisely rather than to be silent unkindly.” \n\nFronto replied, thanking the prince for his advice, and promising that he will confine \nhimself to the facts of the case. But he points out that the charges brought against \nHerodes were such, that they can hardly be made agreeable; amongst them being \n\n                                            \n52 Ad M.

To this Marcus returned the following answer:\n\n53 \n\n“This one thing, my dearest Fronto, is enough to make me truly grateful to you, \nthat so far from rejecting my counsel, you have even approved it. As to the \nquestion you raise in your kind letter, my opinion is this: all that concerns the \ncase which you are supporting must be clearly brought forward; what concerns \nyour own feelings, though you may have had just provocation, should be left \nunsaid.” \n\nThe story does credit to both. Fronto shows no loss of temper at the interference, nor \nshrinks from stating his case with frankness; and Marcus, with forbearance remark-\nable in a prince, does not command that his friend be left unmolested, but merely \nstipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the case. \n\n54 \n\nAnother example may he given from a letter of Fronto’s:\n\n“Here is something else quarrelsome and querulous. I have sometimes found \nfault with you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few of \nmy most intimate friends: at times, for example, when you mixt in society with \na more solemn look than was fitting, or would read books in the theatre or in a \nbanquet; nor did I absent myself from theatre or banquet when you did.\n\n55 Then \n\nI used to call you a hard man, no good company, even disagreeable, sometimes, \nwhen anger got the better of me. But did any one else in the same banquet \nspeak against you, I could not endure to hear it with equanimity. Thus it was \neasier for me to say something to your disadvantage myself, than to hear others \ndo it; just as I could more easily bear to chastise my daughter Gratia, than to \nsee her chastised by another.” \n\nThe affection between them is clear from every page of the correspondence. A few in-\nstances are now given, which were written at different periods: \n\n56 \n\nTO MY MASTER.\n\n“This is how I have past the last few days. My sister was suddenly seized with \nan internal pain, so violent that I was horrified at her looks; my mother in her \ntrepidation on that account accidentally bruised her side on a corner of the \nwall; she and we were greatly troubled about that blow. For myself; on going to \nrest I found a scorpion in my bed; but I did not lie down upon him, I killed him \nfirst. If you are getting on better, that is a consolation.

So if \nwe are all right, let me know: what I desire, you know, and how properly I de-\nsire it, I know. Farewell, my master, always in every chance first in my mind, as \nyou deserve to be. My master, see I am not asleep, and I compel myself to sleep, \nthat you may not be angry with me. You gather I am writing this late at night.” \n\n59 “What spirit do you suppose is in me, when I remember how long it is since I \nhave seen you, and why I have not seen you 1 and it may be I shall not see you \nfor a few days yet, while you are strengthening yourself; as you must. So while \nyou lie on the sick-bed, my spirit also will lie low anti, whenas,\n\n60 by God’s mer-\n\ncy you shall stand upright, my spirit too will stand firm, which is now burning \nwith the strongest desire for you. Farewell, soul of your prince, your friend, \nyour pupil.” \n\n61 “O my dear Fronto, most distinguished Consul! I yield, you have conquered: \nall who have ever loved before, you have conquered out and out in love’s con-\ntest. Receive the victor’s wreath; and the herald shall proclaim your victory \naloud before your own tribunal: “M. Cornelius Fronto, Consul, wins, and is \ncrowned victor in the Open International Love-race.”\n\n62 But beaten though I may \n\nbe, I shall neither slacken nor relax my own zeal. Well, you shall love me more \nthan any man loves any other man; but I, who possess a faculty of loving less \nstrong, shall love you more than any one else loves you; more indeed than you \nlove yourself. Gratia and I will have to fight for it; I doubt I shall not get the bet-\nter of her. For, as Plautus says, her love is like rain, whose big drops not only \npenetrate the dress, but drench to the very marrow.” \n\nMarcus Aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when the corre-\nspondence begins, Fronto being some thirty years older.\n\n63 The systematic education \n\nof the young prince seems to have been finisht, and Pronto now acts more as his ad-\nviser than his tutor. He recommends the prince to use simplicity in his public \nspeeches, and to avoid affectation.\n\n64 Marcus devotes his attention to the old authors \n\nwho then had a great vogue at Rome: Ennius, Plautus, Nævius, and such orators as \n\n                                            \n58 [Ibid.] iii. 21. \n\n59 [Ibid.] ii. 2. \n\n60 The writer sometimes uses archaisms such as quom, which I render ‘whenas.’ \n\n61 [Ibid.] ii. 2. \n\n62 The writer parodies the proclamation at the Greek games; the words also are Greek. \n\n63 From internal evidence: the letters are not arranged in order of time.

Marcus gives his nights to reading when he ought to be sleeping. \nHe exercises himself in verse composition and on rhetorical themes. \n\n66 “to ask for my hexameters; I would \n\n“It is very nice of you,” he writes to Fronto,\n\nhave sent them at once if I had them by me. The fact is my secretary, Anicetus \n— you know who I mean — did not pack up any of my compositions for me to \ntake away with me. He knows my weakness; he was afraid that if I got hold of \nthem I might, as usual, make smoke of them. However, there was no fear for \nthe hexameters. I must confess the truth to my master: I love them. I study at \nnight, since the day is taken up with the theatre. I am weary of an evening, and \nsleepy in the daylight, and so I don’t do much. Yet I have made extracts from \nsixty books, five volumes of them, in these latter days. But when you read re-\nmember that the “sixty” includes plays of Novius, and farces, and some little \nspeeches of Scipio; don’t be too much startled at the number. You remember \nyour Polemon; but I pray you do not remember Horace, who has died with Pol-\nlio as far as I am concerned.\n\n67 Farewell, my dearest and most affectionate \n\nfriend, most distinguished consul and my beloved master, whom I have not \nseen these two years. Those who say two months, count the days. Shall I ever \nsee you again?” \n\nSometimes Fronto sends him a theme to work up, as thus: “M. Lucilius tribune of \nthe people violently throws into prison a free Roman citizen, against the opinion of \nhis colleagues who demand his release. For this act he is branded by the censor. An-\nalyse the case, and then take both sides in turn, attacking and defending.”\n\n68 Or \n\nagain: “A Roman consul, doffing his state robe, dons the gauntlet and kills a lion \namongst the young men at the Quinquatrus in full view of the people of Rome. De-\nnunciation before the censors.”\n\n69 The prince has a fair knowledge of Greek, and \n\nquotes from Homer, Plato, Euripides, but for some reason Fronto dissuaded him \nfrom this study.\n\n70 His Meditations are written in Greek. He continued his literary \n\nstudies throughout his life, and after he became emperor we still find him asking his \nadviser for copies of Cicero’s Letters, by which he hopes to improve his vocabulary.\n\n71 \n\nPronto Helps him with a supply of similes, which, it seems, he did not think of readi-\nly. It is to be feared that the fount of Marcus’s eloquence was pumped up by artificial \nmeans. \n\n                                            \n65 [Ibid.] ii. 10, iii. 18, ii. 4. \n\n66 [Ibid.] ii. 10. \n\n67 He implies, as in i. 6, that he has ceased to study Horace. Pollio was a grammarian, who taught Marcus. \n\n68 [Ibid.] v. 27. \n\n69 [Ibid.] v. 22. \n\n70 Ep. Gracae, 6. \n\n71 Ad Anton. Imp., 1I. 4. \n"

If \nyou ask what I thought of him, listen. He seems to me an industrious farmer, \nendowed with the greatest skill, who has cultivated a large estate for corn and \nvines only, and indeed with a rich return of fine crops. But yet in that land of \nhis there is no Pompeian fig or Arician vegetable, no Tarentine rose, or pleasing \ncoppice, or thick grove, or shady plane tree; all is for use rather than for pleas-\nure, such as one ought rather to commend, but cares not to love. \n\n“A pretty bold idea, is it not, and rash judgment, to pass censure on a man of \nsuch reputation? But whenas I remember that I am writing to you, I think I am \nless bold than you would have me. \n\n“In that point I am wholly undecided. \n\n“There’s an unpremeditated hendecasyllable for you. So before I begin to poet-\nize, I’ll take an easy with you. Farewell, my heart’s desire, your Verus’s best be-\nloved, most distinguisht consul, master most sweet. Farewell I ever pray, \nsweetest soul. \n\nWhat a letter do you think you have written me I could make bold to say, that \nnever did she who bore me and nurst me, write anything SO delightful, so hon-\ney-sweet. And this does not come of your fine style and eloquence: otherwise \nnot my mother only, but all who breathe.” \n\nTo the pupil, never was anything on earth so fine as his master’s eloquence; on this \ntheme Marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm. \n\n73 “Well, if the ancient Greeks ever wrote anything like this, let those who know \ndecide it: for me, if I dare say so, I never read any invective of Cato’s so fine as \nyour encomium.

This oration once \nread, in vain shall we study, in vain shall we toil, in vain strain every nerve. \nFarewell always, most sweet master.” \n\nSometimes Fronto descends from the heights of eloquence to offer practical advice; \nas when he suggests how Marcus should deal with his suite. It is more difficult, he \nadmits, to keep courtiers in harmony than to tame lions with a lute; but if it is to be \ndone, it must be by eradicating jealousy. “Do not let your friends,” says Fronto,”\n\n77 \n\n“envy each other, or think that what you give to another is filched from them. . . . \nKeep away envy from your suite, and you will find your friends kindly and harmoni-\nous.” \n\nHere and there we meet with allusions to his daily life, which we could wish to be \nmore frequent. He goes to the theatre or the law-courts,\n\n78 or takes part in court cer-\n\nemony, but his heart is always with his books. The vintage season, with its religious \nrites, was always spent by Antoninus Pius in the country. The following letters give \nsonic notion of a day’s occupation at that time: \n\n79 “MY DEAREST MASTER, — I am well. To-day I studied from the ninth hour of \nthe night to the second hour of day, after taking food. I then put on my slip-\npers, and from time second to the third hour had a most enjoyable walk up and \ndown before my chamber. Then booted and cloaked — for so we were com-\nmanded to appear — I went to wait upon my lord the emperor. We went a-\nhunting, did doughty deeds, heard a rumour that boars had been caught, but \nthere was nothing to see. However, we climbed a pretty steep hill, and in the af-\nternoon returned home. I went straight to my books. Off with the boots, down \nwith the cloak; I spent a couple of hours in bed. I read Cato’s speech on the \nProperty of Pulchra, and another in which he impeaches a tribune. Ho, ho! I \nhear you cry to your man, Off with you as fast as you can, and bring me these \nspeeches from the library of Apollo. No use to send: I have those books with me \ntoo. You must get round the Tiberian librarian; you will have to spend some-\nthing on the matter; and when I return to town, I shall expect to go shares with \nhim. Well, after reading these speeches I wrote a wretched trifle, destined for \ndrowning or burning. No, indeed my attempt at writing did not come off at all \nto-day; the composition of a hunter or a vintager, whose shouts are echoing \nthrough my chamber, hateful and wearisome as the law-courts. What have I \nsaid? Yes, it was rightly said, for my master is an orator. I think I have caught \n\n                                            \n77 Ad M.

Farewell, dearest \nand most beloved master, whom I miss, I may say, more than Rome itself.” \n\n“MY BELOVED MASTER, — I am well. I slept a little more than usual for my slight \ncold, which seems to be well again. So I spent the time from the eleventh hour \nof the night to the third of the day partly in reading in Cato’s Agriculture, partly \nin writing, not quite so badly as yesterday indeed. Then, after waiting upon my \nfather, I soothed my throat with honey-water, ejecting it without swallowing: I \nmight say gargle, but I won’t, though I think the word is found in Novius and \nelsewhere. After attending to my throat I went to my father, and stood by his \nside as he sacrificed. Then to luncheon. What do you think I had to eat? A bit of \nbread so big, while I watched others gobbling boiled beans, onions, and fish full \nof roe. Then we set to work at gathering the grapes, with plenty of sweat and \nshouting, and, as the quotation runs, “A few high-hanging clusters did we leave \nsurvivors of the vintage.” After the sixth hour we returned home. I did a little \nwork, and poor work at that. Then I had a long gossip with my dear mother sit-\nting on the bed. My conversation was: What do you think my friend Fronto is \ndoing just now? She said: And what do you think of my friend Gratia?”\n\n80 My \n\n81 the sparrowkin? After this kind of \n\nturn now: “And what of our little Gratia,\n\ntalk, and an argument as to which of you loved the other most, the gong \nsounded, the signal that my father had gone to the bath. We supped, after ab-\nlutions in the oil-cellar — I mean we supped after ablutions, not after ablutions \nin the oil-cellar; and listened with enjoyment to the rustics gibing. After return-\ning, before turning on my side to snore, I do my task and give an account of the \nday to my delightful master, whom if I could long for a little more, I should not \nmind growing a trifle thinner. Farewell, Fronto, wherever you are, honey-sweet, \nmy darling, my delight. Why do I want you? I can love you while far away.” \n\n82 \n\nOne anecdote puts Marcus before us in a new light:\n\n“When my father returned home from the vineyards, I mounted my horse as \nusual, and rode on ahead some little way. Well, there on the road was a herd of \nsheep, standing all crowded together as though the place were a desert, with \nfour dogs and two shepherds, but nothing else. Then one shepherd said to an-\nother shepherd, on seeing a number of horsemen: ‘I say,’ says he, ‘look you at \nthose horsemen; they do a deal of robbery.’ When I heard this, I clap spurs to \nmy horse, and ride straight for the sheep. In consternation the sheep scatter; \nhither and thither they are fleeting and bleating. A shepherd throws his fork, \nand the fork falls on the horseman who came next to me. We make our escape.” \n\nWe like Marcus none the worse for this spice of mischief. \n\n                                            \n80 Fronto’s wife. \n\n81 Fronto’s daughter. \n\n82 Ad M.

FRONTO, greeting. \n\n“After I entered the carriage, after I took leave of you, we made a journey com-\nfortable enough, but we had a few drops of rain to wet us. But before coming to \nthe country-house, we broke our journey at Anagnia, a mile or so from the \nhighroad. Then we inspected that ancient town, a miniature it is, but has in it \nmany antiquities, temples, and religious ceremonies quite out of the way. There \nis not a corner without its shrine, or fane, or temple; besides, many books writ-\nten on linen, which belongs to things sacred. Then on the gate as we came out \nwas written twice, as follows: ‘Priest don the fell.’\n\n84 I asked one of the inhabit-\n\nants what that word was. He said it was the word in the Hernican dialect for \nthe victim’s skin, which the priest puts over his conical cap when he enters the \ncity. I found out many other things which I desired to know, but the only thing \nI do not desire is that you should he absent from me; that is my chief anxiety. \nNow for yourself, when you left that place, did you go to Aurelia or to Campa-\nnia? Be sure to write to me, and say whether you have opened the vintage, or \ncarried a host of books to the country-house; this also, whether you miss me; I \nam foolish to ask it, whenas you tell it me of yourself. Now if you miss me and if \nyou love me, send me your letters often, which is a comfort and consolation to \nme. Indeed I should prefer ten times to read your letters than all the vines of \nGaurus or the Marsians; for these Signian vines have grapes too rank and fruit \ntoo sharp in the taste, but I prefer wine to must for drinking. Besides, those \ngrapes are nicer to eat dried than fresh-ripe; I vow I would rather tread them \nunder foot than put my teeth in them. But I pray they may be gracious and for-\ngiving, and grant me free pardon for these jests of mine. Farewell, best friend, \ndearest, most learned, sweetest master. When you see the must ferment in the \nvat, remember that just so in my heart the longing for you is gushing and flow-\ning and bubbling. Good-bye.” \n\nMaking all allowances for conventional exaggerations, it is clear from the corre-\nspondence that there was deep love between Marcus and his preceptor. The letters \ncover several years in succession, but soon after the birth of Marcus’s daughter, \nFaustina, there is a large gap. It does not follow that the letters ceased entirely, be-\ncause we know part of the collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse \nbetween Marcus and Fronto after Marcus took to the study of philosophy under the \nguidance of Rusticus. \n\nWhen Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters begin again, with slightly \nincreased formality on Fronto’s part, and they go on for some four years, when Fron-\nto, who has been continually complaining of ill-health, appears to have died. One let-\nter of the later period gives some interesting particulars of the emperor’s public life, \n\n                                            \n83 Ad M. Cæs iv. 4. \n\n84 Samentum. \n"

Fronto speaks of Marcus’s victories and eloquence in the \nusual strain of high praise, and then continues:\n\n85 \n\n“The army when you took it in hand was sunk in luxury and revelry, and cor-\nrupted with long inactivity. At Antiochia the soldiers had been Wont to applaud \nat the stage plays, knew more of the gardens at the nearest restaurant than of \nthe battlefield. Horses were hairy from lack of grooming, horsemen smooth be-\ncause their hairs had been pulled out by the roots;\n\n86 a rare thing it was to see a \n\nsoldier with hair on arm or leg. Moreover, they were better drest than armed; so \nmuch so, that Laelianus Pontius. a strict man of the old discipline, broke the \ncuirasses of some of them with his finger-tips, and observed cushions on the \nhorses’ backs. At his direction the tufts were cut through, and out of the \nhorsemen’s saddles came what appeared to be feathers pluckt from geese. Few \nof the men could vault on horseback, the rest clambered up with difficulty by \naid of heel and knee and leg not many could throw a lance hurtling, most did it \nwithout force or power, as though they were things of wool. dicing was common \nin the camp, sleep lasted all night, or if they kept watch it was over the wine-\ncup. By what regulations to restrain such soldiers as these, and to turn them to \nhonesty and industry, did you not learn from Hannibal’s sternness, the disci-\npline of Africanus, the acts of Metellus recorded in history?” \n\nAfter the preceptorial letters cease the others are concerned with domestic events, \nhealth and sickness, visits or introductions, birth or death. Thus the emperor writes \nto his old friend, who had shown some diffidence in seeking an interview:\n\n87 \n\n“TO MY MASTER. \n\n“I have a serious grievance against you, my dear master, yet indeed my grief is \nmore than my grievance, because after so long a time I neither embraced you \nnor spoke to you, though you visited the palace, and the moment after I had \nleft the prince my brother. I reproached my brother severely for not recalling \nme; nor durst he deny the fault.” \n\nFronto again writes on one occasion: “I have seen your daughter. It was like seeing \nyou and Faustina in infancy, so much that is charming her face has taken from each \nof yours.” Or again, at a later date:\n\n88 \n\n“I have seen your chicks, most delightful sight that ever I saw in my life, so like \nyou that nothing is more like than the likeness. . . . By the mercy of Heaven \nthey have a healthy colour and strong lungs. One held a piece of white bread, \nlike a little prince, the other a common piece, like a true philosophers son.” \n\nMarcus, we know, was devoted to his children. They were delicate in health, in spite \nof Fronto’s assurance, and only one son survived the father. We find echoes of this \naffection now and again in the letters. “We have summer heat here still,” writes Mar-\ncus, “but since my little girls are pretty well, if I may say so, it is like the bracing cli-\n                                            \n85 Ad Verum.

The poor old man suffered a heavy blow in \nthe death of his grandson, on which Marcus writes:\n\n91 “I have just heard of your mis-\n\nfortune. Feeling grieved as I do when one of your joints gives you pain, what do you \nthink I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?” The old man’s reply, in spite \nof a certain self-consciousness, is full of pathos. He recounts with pride the events of \na long and upright life, in which he has wronged no man, and lived in harmony with \nhis friends and family. His affectations fall away from him, as the cry of pain is \nforced from his heart: \n\n92 “Many such sorrows has fortune visited me with all my life long. To pass by \nmy other afflictions, I have lost five children under the most pitiful conditions \npossible: for the five I lost one by one when each was my only child, suffering \nthese blows of bereavement in such a manner that each child was born to one \nalready bereaved. Thus I ever lost my children without solace, and got them \namidst fresh grief. . . . ” \n\nThe letter continues with reflections on the nature of death, “more to be rejoiced at \nthan bewailed, the younger one dies,” and an arraignment of Providence not without \ndignity, wrung from him as it were by this last culminating misfortune. It concludes \nwith a summing-up of his life in protest against the blow which has fallen on his grey \nhead: \n\n“Through my long life I have committed nothing which might bring dishonour, \nor disgrace, or shame: no deed of avarice or treachery have I done in all my \nday’s: nay, but much generosity, much kindness, much truth and faithfulness \nhave I shown, often at the risk of my own life. I have lived in amity with my \ngood brother, whom I rejoice to see in possession of the highest office by your \nfather’s goodness, and by your friendship at peace and perfect rest. The offices \nwhich I have myself obtained I never strove for by any underhand means. I \nhave cultivated my mind rather than my body; the pursuit of learning I have \npreferred to increasing my wealth. I preferred to he poor rather than bound by \nany man’s obligation, even to want rather than to beg. I have never been ex-\ntravagant in spending money, I have earned it sometimes because I must. I \nhave scrupulously spoken the truth, and have been glad to hear it spoken to \nme. I have thought it better to be neglected than to fawn, to be dumb than to \nfeign, to be seldom a friend than to be often a flatterer. 1 have sought little, de-\nserved not little.

In those which \nhere follow, certain emendations of his are mentioned, which he proposes in his \nnotes, and follows in the translation. In addition, one or two corrections are made \nwhere he has mistaken the Greek, and the translation might be misleading. Those \nwhich do not come under these two heads will explain themselves. \n\nThe text itself has been prepared by a comparison of the editions of 1634 and 1635. \nIt should he borne in mind that Casaubon’s is often rather a paraphrase than a close \ntranslation; and it did not seem worth while to notice every variation or amplification \nof the original. In the original editions all that Casaubon conceives as understood, \nbut not expressed, is enclosed in square brackets. These brackets are here omitted, \nas they interfere with the comfort of the reader; and so have some of the alternative \nrenderings suggested by the translator. In a few cases, Latin words in the text have \nbeen replaced by English. \n\nNumbers in brackets refer to the Teubner text of Stich, but the divisions of the text \nare left unaltered.
